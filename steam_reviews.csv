Cyberpunk 2077,1091500,"This game brought tears to my eyes and it helped me through my divorce with my wife, she took the kids but that's OK Judy is the love of my life.

Cyberpunk 2077,1091500,"Even if the game already has a decent amount of contents that are worth the price, in my opinion the potential of NC setting, storytelling is not fully realized yet. You can feel many contents are cut out in an unnatural way. Moreover the gameplay can be further polished.I hope they get the money they want to do better at their next game, take their time to achieve something like Rockstar's games.",Positive

Cyberpunk 2077,1091500,"When it came out, the game definitely wasn't what was promised, but I honestly liked it. It was a buggy mess but still kept me interested. Now it's fantastic. There are still some bugs, but nothing big in my experience. The performance on launch day and now are like day and night. Nice recovery CDPR!",Positive

Cyberpunk 2077,1091500,"Gotta say, I first played this game upon release, one of the worst experiences I ever had with a game, but now that I've been replaying it, this is the experience I wanted. They truly brought it back from the grave, loving going back through and taking my time, as i sped through last time since I hated it so much. They did a good job, and im excited to get phantom liberty after I finish the main story!",Positive
Cyberpunk 2077,1091500,Brilliant.,Positive
Cyberpunk 2077,1091500,Literally the gift that keeps on giving. It started out funny then slick became the  best game of this generation.,Positive
Cyberpunk 2077,1091500,"Story is great so far, just finished prologue and interlude",Positive
Cyberpunk 2077,1091500,"Bought the game when it 1st released on ps4 and man the issues were absolutely terrible as we all know, recently decided to get it on steam and for the price I wasn't disappointed one bit. The fact they added bits of the anime edgerunner series into the story just made the already amazing story that much more entertaining. Would honestly play another 50h in this game just to explore all I missed on my 1st playthrough.",Positive

Cyberpunk 2077,1091500,Banger.,Positive
Cyberpunk 2077,1091500,"Map is big and detailed, but it's not beautiful. It's dirty.Fast travel is convenient and vehicles are fast.Can be played by just focusing on the main story quests and ignoring all the tedious side job quests.Since it's a rpg, the FPS game play is not satisfying and bosses are bullet sponges. Stealth is terrible.Everyone runs away when you punch in the air.There are no flying cars.The tutorial is long and boring.",Positive
Cyberpunk 2077,1091500,"The 2.0 Update and Phantom Liberty are what the game should've been on release and they've definitely won back the respect and good faith. PL is amazing and so is the new 2.0 update, been LOVING the game. Thanks CDPR",Positive

Cyberpunk 2077,1091500,Good game,Positive
Cyberpunk 2077,1091500,"One of the best games I ever played.The basegame is fantastic, and Phantom Liberty only adds on more excellent content. The bugs are -mostly- gone, and the rare ones that show up more or less make me go ""haha, that's stupid"" instead of being frustrating.I am very picky about the games I play, and a rare few treasures capture me like Cyberpunk did. I can't recommend it enough.",Positive

Cyberpunk 2077,1091500,bobs,Positive
Cyberpunk 2077,1091500,"It's good to know that after the 2.0 update, Cyberpunk 2077 has finally released. Solid game, good story and gameplay. It IS resource-intensive so make sure you're up to spec, otherwise enjoy.",Positive
Cyberpunk 2077,1091500,More addicting than cigarettes and literally just keeps getting better and better with each update.The only reason why this game was unfinished at launch is because CDPR was unable to code fast enough with one hand. For some reason all productivity came to a screeching halt after CDPR finished Panams character model.,Positive
Cyberpunk 2077,1091500,Un-modded experience is polished and clean. Feels intuitive and complex at the same time. Allows for multiple story paths even within each start path. Can't wait to try the game modded and would recommend for 'must have' shelf for any gamer.,Positive
Cyberpunk 2077,1091500,"Enjoyed the game a lot. Always enjoyed action games. The story can be very emotional, but the player choice and romance stories are iffy. I use a bunch of mods to help with game loading and it still runs slow a lot, but the game itself is pretty good.",Positive

Cyberpunk 2077,1091500,mid,Negative
Cyberpunk 2077,1091500,"This game controls like the product of an aspiring solo developers first FPS game made in unity, which is to say, it controls like hot garbage from 2001. Halo CE had better gameplay over 20 years ago. To say this has disappointed me would be a massive understatement and I resent the fact that the tutorial was JUST long enough that I can't refund the game.",Negative
Cyberpunk 2077,1091500,"Game is a hot mess,fix your game before telling people you've done a big update.MY GAME FLATLINED AS SOON AS JOHNNY GETS CAPTURED AFTER BOMBING ARASAKA,MEETING THE OLD MAN. MUTIPLE TRYS AND I CANT GET TO NEXT LEVEL FIX YOUR DAMN GAME PLEASE",Negative

Cyberpunk 2077,1091500,"Somewhat Damaged is appalling, made me uninstall the game",Negative
Cyberpunk 2077,1091500,2.0 Update completely deleted my ultimate quickhack netrunner build.  Glad that CDPR decided to nerf playstyles in a single player game.My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.,Negative

Cyberpunk 2077,1091500,Too many bugs,Negative
Cyberpunk 2077,1091500,buggy,Negative
Cyberpunk 2077,1091500,"I bought this on sale, and was shocked to see the amount of glitches in this game. You'll turn down a street and see half-rendered polygons walking around. After a few moments they materialize and then you see every person on the street is the exact same NPC lol. Cars randomly explode in the sky, you turn around and all-of-a-sudden 50 people spawn screaming and running, people make the ""T"" shape and hover around. I thought these were problems with the game on release, not after the most recent patching. That and the loading screens make it hard to play.",Negative
Cyberpunk 2077,1091500,"The game was great until the 2.0 patch which completely ruined and re modified the character builds.    I have over 300 hours of game play with my two characters built perfectly.  Then, when patch 2.0 hit, it completely reset them and changed everything about them.  This is a single player game, not an mmo.  Resetting people's characters for no damn reason is not a good way to keep players playing when they have hundreds of hours invested in their character that were built a certain way and learned how to play the game that way for hundred of hours.   I understand patching can be a good thing for bugs, AI, NPC's, environmental etc, but resetting people's character builds is f'ed up.",Negative
Cyberpunk 2077,1091500,Game is still riddled with bugs,Negative
Cyberpunk 2077,1091500,Product received for freeGame is great but the game is still not fixed after 2 years. Constant crashes and game breaking glitches,Negative
Cyberpunk 2077,1091500,Expansion is hours of scripted sandboxed obnoxious and frustrating puzzles and bosses.  Would not recommend.,Negative
Cyberpunk 2077,1091500,"I cannot recommend this game, at least for Steam deck. While the story and gameplay are okay, the game simply won't run functionally on the steam deck without regularly crashing after an hour or so. The deck simply can't handle running it without overheating quickly, at which point it becomes unplayable. The frame rate in general doesn't hold steady to 30FPS too well, but it's smooth enough to play for that first hour. I wouldn't recommend buying it for the steam deck unless you only want to play for an hour at a time.It's like GTA but with some future tech RPG skill elements. Overall it's okay.",Negative
Cyberpunk 2077,1091500,"The game is still broken for many people. I cannot even launch the game without it crashing. I have not played a single second, and have spent more than a few hours just trying to get it to launch. CDPR is a joke, and their customer support is nonexistent. Maybe its worth a shot if you can play it, but if its crashing at launch, save yourself the time and effort and just get a refund.",Negative

Cyberpunk 2077,1091500,Game Keeps crashing then you will get a error message saying game has flatlined with no fix..This is why i hate and never truss updates,Negative
Cyberpunk 2077,1091500,"This is a beautiful looking game with fantastic storytelling and gameplay. Unfortunately, after 25 hours the game now crashes everytime I have tried to load a save.",Negative
Cyberpunk 2077,1091500,"Even after being out for 3 years this game is still too buggy to play.  I love the world and the creative team did a great job but the game was really let down by the programming department.  I've run into multiple game ending bugs as well as a plethora of smaller bugs.  It's really frustrating trying to figure out what you're doing wrong in a mission and then after doing research on the internet you find out that the quest has just been bugged from release day and it's still not been fixed.  And that was one of the tutorial missions. ""Luckily"" they let you skip the tutorial but now I'm wishing they hadn't because I would have returned the game at that time and not spent hours slogging through the buggiest release I've ever played.",Negative
Cyberpunk 2077,1091500,Game is fun when it works but its buggy as hell. 3 years later and cant finish story line due to the phone bugging out.,Negative

Cyberpunk 2077,1091500,"another game where you go to a base and kill people 50,000 times in side missions before you get sick of it and never finish the main story line. doesn't offer anything new, feels like reskin of fallout with terrible driving mechanics. story is interesting enough, but generic at the end of the day. keanu wasn't anything special, if anything he sounded like he didn't want to be in the recording booth half the time",Negative
Cyberpunk 2077,1091500,your choices don't matter. you will die in the end regardless of what you do and how you play it out. there is no good ending.,Negative

Cyberpunk 2077,1091500,A profoundly boring open-world RPG with a story and characters I don't care about and one of the weakest cyberpunk aesthetics I've seen. Also the obsession this game has with Japan is embarrassing.,Negative
Cyberpunk 2077,1091500,"It is 2023, the game has been released for 3 years, and the pc keybind system doesn't work.  Also, driving feels like you are on a boat with the rudder dragging on the bottom of the lake.",Negative

Cyberpunk 2077,1091500,"Still broken as heck.I played this on day one, and it was every bit the mess everyone thought it was. After 2.0 they claimed it was better, but I still get model bugs in the main story, T-posing peds everywhere in the ""welcome to night city"" cinematic, and a lot of various issues. If you're waiting for the game to be fixed, keep waiting.",Negative
Cyberpunk 2077,1091500,2 Patches and an upgrade for my own setup and the game still crashes when I try to play it.I never had the chance to play the expansion and the base game is locked behund a new pc because apparently my current one is to weak fo this game.Game is nothing amazing it's ok at best but that is only the case if one you know could play it.Get it when a sale hits because full price is too much for this.,Negative

Cyberpunk 2077,1091500,"Shoe-horned story line with a path already laid out for you, cant be your own character. Also this game is about half cut scenes.. I just want to play a game, not watch it. AI is dumb, found cars burning in middle of roads with NPCs in them not doing anything, same with the cops right behind them.World feels like multiple dev teams worked on individual projects then smashed them all together. Hell one of the opening missions has your character lean out of a bullet-proof car window that magically isn't there and re-appears after the scene...Not sure how it got ""Very Positive"" reviews off half ass game.",Negative

I had faith, eventually they'd get things heading in the right directions.  Game on sale.. looking at the recent reviews... sounds like a good time to pick it up.This game, out of the gate, crashed, then I started playing it and the story is from the get go just so predictable, and linear with zero choice... it was horrendous.  Some people will put up with anything, and have low standards, and will allow this publisher to get away with crap... apparently due to love for their past projects.  I just can't do it.  I uninstalled this and at this point would not recommend this to anyone.  At really any price.  I paid half price and feel totally ripped off...  0 out of 10.",Negative

I have never played it before, I haven't installed any mods, but I did purchase the game together with the DLC. I however haven't managed to reach the main menu.After launching, it shows the opening where it says ""cyberpunk"", and then it crashes, right back to the desktop. It asks me to sent a crash report and what not.I've tried everything I can think of. I started by verifying integrity of game files, reinstalled the game, reinstalled nvidia drivers, ran in admin, and skipped the CD project red launcher using ""--launcher-skip"" in the launch options, but nothing changed. Also, my computer specs should be well above the minimum required to run the game.I have been trying to launch the game for a couple days with no success.

You cant see anyone. I only played one match before giving up on the analog controls of just basically moving. Lags like crazy and its so pixelated you can't see anyone. On console it gives you no tutorial on what controls do nor how they function except ""training"" which is not training at all. For some reason strafing makes your character run and move faster but walking forward is like tippy toeing and clicking to run is a mess as the game does not properly read inputs from controller or it just works odd. I found my thumb aching after jamming the analog so many times trying to figure just how to normally move, what a joke! Even low sub par games don't have that issue. Nothing explains how or why this works in game. Yet you can move faster crouched? Lmao. This game is a joke. Not to mention the countless bugs and hackers. My first match the game had several bugs and 2 people hacking the match. I quickly Uninstalled and never looked back after having it for less than an hour. Not even worth it. It makes no sense, nothing explains what anything does and the controls and games is laggy, poorly performed, bad inputs, laggy multiplayer. God awful graphics that are so pixelated on console it makes any PS2 game look like next generation graphics. Dont buy.

Sure, haters are gonna hate but when you take in the complexity of the game design and what Bethesda have achieved, superb. The only gripe I have is that there should be more guidance on building outposts and ships, or maybe it's just, my simple brain that struggles with it! Love it though.",Positive
Starfield,1716740,"Smooth action, engaging world. Love just exploring and immersing myself in the field of stars!",Positive

Starfield,1716740,"highly replayable, fantastic story line, defiantly a Bethesda game complete with a few broken quests but community patches fix this.",Positive
Starfield,1716740,If you liked Fallout III and VI I think you will like this.,Positive
Starfield,1716740,"Great game, after you mod the heck out of it of course. so many badly done features at release or features that should be included but where not. Thank you Modder's for fixing the game. Game coders do better, Gamer company admins... let them.",Positive
Starfield,1716740,"A great game, but could be so much better. I hope this first DLC comes fast.",Positive
Starfield,1716740,"Great game, very much like Fallout 4",Positive
Starfield,1716740,"Yes, I love this game.  I like the diverse landscapes, and the slow steady exploring of planets.  Also, the varied mix of missions types is great. Parts of it remind me of 'fallout' , which is a fun vibe.",Positive
Starfield,1716740,"It's not everything I wanted, but it's a good game to relax to.",Positive
Starfield,1716740,"Todd, you've done a great job, but Redfall might be better.",Positive
Starfield,1716740,"This is my kind of game. One that I can play my way. No fixed linear story based missions with only one successful outcome. A game that allows me to play the story but also leave it behind for a while and do other things, in my own time and in my own way. Over 400 hours played and I am still immersed in all the rich story telling and diverse characters that light up this amazing universe. Bethesda, I thank you for creating a wonderful universe for me to play in.",Positive
Starfield,1716740,Good game I enjoyed it a lot.,Positive
Starfield,1716740,"Despite its many flaws, I have thoroughly enjoy playing this game.",Positive
Starfield,1716740,game is fun,Positive
Starfield,1716740,I would wait for a sale. Still did not surpass Skyrim but still a fun game. On my second play through.,Positive
Starfield,1716740,skyrim? is that you?,Positive
Starfield,1716740,"A little bit boring on the story and gameplay side, but if you like spacey stuff, customizing ships and overall just chill gameplay, go for itdont expet Skyring level shennanigans or fun quests, there is a couple notable ones and thats it",Positive
Starfield,1716740,"What people don't understand about gaming is that if a game is fun, that's all that matters. Who cares if this game's performance gives you schizophrenia, who cares that if you pull out your weapon in front of guards and civilians they don't react. This game has great quests, characters, and music. Remember when devs cared about those things? Well, these devs do. You really can tell that they worked really hard on this game. And I can say without a doubt that Starfield is one of the best games I've played in a long time.",Positive
Starfield,1716740,"it's the space game i've been waiting for. there are some glitch, yes, but still the most awesome space game ever IMHO.",Positive
Starfield,1716740,Game allows you to go off on your own or follow story.  This is my favourite style of game.,Positive
Starfield,1716740,"So far it's a nice game looks awesome,but plz Bethesda add some land vehicles.",Positive
Starfield,1716740,So far a great game little buggy with the waypoint marker upon doing adjectives but it's aspected. But over all a lot of gameplay into it.,Positive
Starfield,1716740,"The game is fun, people be hating on it way too much",Positive
Starfield,1716740,"It might improve now I have done the main story quest?The quest which you get near the end of the story called Over designed seems like it might be a self aware parody of how Starfield was made. If you go with the Kitchen sink budget option, and then try to please everyone on the design team you get a technically correct Frankenstein of a ship that on paper is all things for everyone.In reality it is a good way to get your hands on some in-game currency and a foundation to make a new and better ship without grinding for credits.Obstructive mechanisms such as resource gathering and ineffective storage and trade links spoil aspects of the game that might be more fun. I forgot my character had special powers as I never seemed to need them. Once I maxed the skills needed to build a class C ship I didn't need any tactics to win a space battle, and the same was true for my Space suit and weapons and the foot bound combat system.I would have loved to build complex supply chains and outposts across the exported stars but could not seems to make it work as it seemed it should have.Base defence might have been fun if you could build a wall.The woke agenda has also had its effect as well, the game seems to promote things that are socially destructive like drugs and there is no really gritty or mature content other than some lame innuendo.When you blow someone up they should get blown up, some nudity is appropriate without being exploitative if it isn't gratuitous the best stories leave some things to the imagination and provide details to pull you in.Perhaps the game budget could have included alternate animations and in-game assets to cater to players' tastes.I am glad I played Starfield through, and may look at a modded play though when we see some maturity in the overhauls and bug fix mods.I liked the vision but not the execution of Starfield.",Positive
Starfield,1716740,great!,Positive
Starfield,1716740,Great game. One of my favorite games ever.,Positive
Starfield,1716740,AMAZING! I LOVE IT! Just what i was looking for!,Positive

Starfield,1716740,"I had a lot of problems at first, but moving from D to C drive fixed most issues.  I enjoy the exploration of new worlds, and like the variety of quests.",Positive
Starfield,1716740,"I love it. Maybe I'm easy to please, but I enjoy playing this one as much as I enjoy Skyrim and Fallout 4. They are different games and It definitely has some issues, but I'm semi-confident they will eventually be addressed. Either way, this game has absorbed a bunch of my time, and it will continue to do so.",Positive
Starfield,1716740,"The Start is a little rigid but it really gets you going. The game takes time to get used to but its a whole new adventure that I,m learning to love",Positive
Starfield,1716740,"For me this is the best game I ever played. If you like space games, this one has it all....",Positive
Starfield,1716740,Stop !!! If you're going to go into this game thinking it's going to be like every Bethesda game just don't open your mind to New horizons... I've played this game for 181.7 hours and my honest opinions yes it has bugs yes the loading screens do suck yes you do get to a point where things just blend in after 100 or so hours... But the games enjoyable and fun sometimes I get sucked into it exploring every little corner seeing if there's anything hidden doing wacky stuff.. and the story and the four main side missions are really well put together.. I say play you'll enjoy just don't go in thinking it's going to be like elder scrolls or fallout this is a new IP trying new things that Bethesda never done before and I can see the love and passion that they had when they were making the game... This game is a building block of hopefully what will come if there's a sequel...and lol please put out the creation kit ...,Positive
Starfield,1716740,"Starfield is a Bethesda game, no denying it but it is a nice game to wander through.",Positive
Starfield,1716740,"excellent game, content and free roaming rpg. buy this game and play it forever.",Positive
Starfield,1716740,Fallout in space,Positive
Starfield,1716740,Outstanding game! Love the story as well as the exploration! Keep up the great work!,Positive
Starfield,1716740,Great game with a lot of future potential. On my second playthrough and I  don't do multiple playthroughs very often! lots to see and do.,Positive
Starfield,1716740,"If you love exploring and RPG then this game offers a lot of options. You can almost be whatever you want to be.  I can see great potential in this platform! There are so may 'quests' you can do in each city, on each planet,  that you find yourself sidetracked from what you set out to do.  As with other Bethesda games this game will evolve and grow into something that will be enjoyable for years to come. If you played the Fallout 4 without any DLC or mods you would think that's mediocre. Plus the Fallout games are set in a small area whereas Starfield has an expansive area with so many different biospheres.  I love this game because you can just go out and do what the heck you want to. Explore, build, become a pirate, be the strong force for good, or evil.",Positive
Starfield,1716740,"GOTY for me, will be playing this for a long time",Positive
Starfield,1716740,Great game! Just avoid negative comments!,Positive
Starfield,1716740,yeah ok,Positive
Starfield,1716740,"Not great, not terrible.To be honest it's a soulless game. A kind of Andromeda after the MassEffect series, a playable fail.",Positive
Starfield,1716740,"I only really like Bethesda games. So far I'm enjoying it. I am having some issues with occasional hard crash to desktop however. this is my first PC build so it may be, I need to tweak some settings.positives- some of the artwork is stunning, the music is beautiful and its got all the mechanics i like and expect from BSG.Negatives- yes, there are too many load screens, they don't take long but it is jarring. The companions are a bit annoying. I suck at space combat so being forced into it the minute i arrive in a system gets old.in summary, enjoying the main quest so far, looking forward to see what Bethesda do, in regards to updates, DLC etc.",Positive
Starfield,1716740,"If you enjoyed Elder Scrolls and the Fallout series, this game is for you. Not as buggy as reviewers have reported. If you played No Mans Sky, this game is not to be compared, although you will find yourself tempted to. This game is quest and story driven. Gun play is great, combat is very fun, tons to loot, base building, and ship creating is fantastic. Expect some Bethesda bugs, which I personally find hilarious and fun to run into, although they are not often. Also this game is a time sucker - you will easily dump many hours into the game before you even know really what is going on. Bethesda could have also done a better job of explaining how to do certain things, but Google and Reddit will be your best friend when it comes to this. Overall fantastic game so far and I am always looking forward to picking up where I left off.",Positive
Starfield,1716740,BGS at its finest.,Positive
Starfield,1716740,Didn't live up to the hype but still a good game. Done nearly 100 hours now casually. Stick to the main faction and story quests.,Positive
Starfield,1716740,"Has its problems, but I love it",Positive
Starfield,1716740,"Starfield is a good game for those who are looking for a fun RPG. I have been a huge fan of the Fallout series in the past and was very excited to play Starfield.Yes this game has some bugs, but what game doesn't have one? I finished the main story line today for the first time and I was amazed by the depth of the story. You can also choose to blaze your own path and do one of the dozens if not hundreds of side quests at any time.I think if you're a fan of past Bethesda games, you will enjoy this one too. Don't let all the negative reviews change your mind. Give it a shot!",Positive
Starfield,1716740,yes has its fault and many ways reminds me of No mans sky launch give it a bit of time and could be a amazing game i have put over 1000 hours so feel i have a right to comment the badTo many loading screens with no imagination cut to a black screen and a loading symbol .Could have made a animation to try and keep immersion.modding tool d SLR at launch would have been better.Must say very few game breaking bugs through out my first play through 900 hours you can play this game as fast as you want or as slow as you want hence why i am only on 2nd play through,Positive
Starfield,1716740,"After 30 hours of playtime, Sarah is still playing hard to get. I'll update once I've navigated her Starfield.",Positive

Starfield,1716740,Skyrim in spaaaaace,Positive
Starfield,1716740,I like it.,Positive
Starfield,1716740,"I quit playing this game at 60 hrs because it grew old.The fact that you cannot make your authority respected onboard of your ship is displeasant to say the least. The lack of choice in your different answers makes this game very frustrating.For example, I was interrogating patients in an hospital to find someone and I figured out another one of them was also a criminal. There was no option for me to not snitch that person in exchange for nothing at all, so I was forced to accept credits and then the silly girl following me got complaining at me again about how bad I am.Since this game I think I loss the interest in gaming in general...I still have to recommend it because it is good entertainment and already better than most games in many ways.",Positive
Starfield,1716740,I like this game but for some reason it is not starting,Positive
Starfield,1716740,Addicting...I wasn't ready for how fun this game is!,Positive
Starfield,1716740,Never in moods to finish it!,Positive
Starfield,1716740,"I enjoy BGS games, and I enjoy this one but honestly they just took it out of the oven a little to early...",Positive
Starfield,1716740,"As a long time skyrim,player as well as fallout i can say Im happy with it would give 5 stars idgaf",Positive
Starfield,1716740,The game is decent.Nothing spectacular.Graphics are both good and bad.Story?  Not sure I explore and do what I want.A lot of repeatable exploration sites are to common honestly.To be honest though . . .I bought it for the modding community.,Positive
Starfield,1716740,"Theres alot of stuff to do and figure out, the game has a definate learning curve when it comes to crafting, ship construction and base building, there are times it can be overwhelming, but mastering such a complex system is very satisfying.",Positive
Starfield,1716740,"The game is not stupid, but it is boring, nothing interesting, but I will give them a positive rating for one reason, the reason is because they tricked us into buying it......",Positive
Starfield,1716740,"It's not perfect, but over all it is enjoyable. I do really hope the outpost building can be made more enjoyable.",Positive
Starfield,1716740,"Despite the number of haters this game has attracted it's a classic Bethesda title, though in this case they're really gone out of their way to create a very deep, richly detailed engaging series of stories. The faction missions in particular are the  most fun I've had in a videogame for ages.Doubtless this comment will attract the usual sneering derision from people who are furious that the game has loading screens - despite every other Bethesda title since Morrowind having loading screens, or are furious that the game isn't a pure space exploration game in the style of No Man's Sky - or who just speedran and rushed through content, and then concluded it was 'shallow', or merely siubscribed to the memes and groupthink.But if you are independent-minded and willing to form your own conclusions and enjoy a great space adventure yarn you'll probably like Starfield.",Positive
Starfield,1716740,3 hours in and addicted.,Positive
Starfield,1716740,i think the game is Ok,Positive
Starfield,1716740,"This game is really great.  It's kind of like Fallout 4 in space so if you like exploring and shooting things this is the game for you.  It's got lots of content, including scripted storyline missions for a bunch of different factions and some randomly generated areas.",Positive
Starfield,1716740,"so basically people are pissed because they can't play this game like Skyrim. well go back to playing skyrim then. I personally like this NEW IP and I don't mind most of the criticism. it's a still a Bethesda RPG, this time around it happens to be set in space. it's not a perfect game, I already modded my game heavily to make things better like all past Bethesda games but to me that's the fun of Bethesda games, make it your own. it's why I have a lifetime membership at Nexus mods. so those of you that hate this game I'm sure Bethesda will have another Skyrim remake for you to enjoy but for me I'm going back into this new IP to see what else I got to discover",Positive
Starfield,1716740,"If I didn't have a huge backlog of games I bought and never played, I could easily spend another 270 hours playing this. I went through less than half of the content so far.",Positive
Starfield,1716740,4k no man's sky with less features but still ok I guess.,Positive
Starfield,1716740,I have enjoyed my time playing this game. There are a bunch of choices that completely change the game experience. at the time i wrote this I am at 227 hours.,Positive
Starfield,1716740,"Beyond the bug here and there, it's a very detailed game that has been well thought out and implemented.",Positive
Starfield,1716740,"it's a bethesda game, and it plays like one. what did you all expect? love it, it's literally fallout in space.",Positive
Starfield,1716740,Beautiful game. Smooth game play. Super quest line and side quests. Built for the explorer in all of us!,Positive
Starfield,1716740,It can be relaxing and peaceful if you don't take yourself too seriously.,Positive
Starfield,1716740,Skyrim meets Privateer? Yes please! I never expected a studio as big as Bethesda to ever write a AAA title designed specifically for me but I'll take it!,Positive
Starfield,1716740,a lot to do if your into single player games with building and exploration,Positive
Starfield,1716740,Bloody brilliant.  I would recommend this game to anyone.   Never played anything like it.  Fantastic.,Positive
Starfield,1716740,"in a sea of open world bethesda games, this is one of them. a relaxing jawn.",Positive
Starfield,1716740,"Not a great game, but I had fun!",Positive
Starfield,1716740,"I love this game so much. In this age single-player games is such a rare thing. Thank you for this game.The only one thing i missed is transport to travel thru planet, bike or something would be cool.",Positive
Starfield,1716740,"It's a great game. The dialog is quite heavy, and the requirement of an SSD drive will likely prevent a lot of people from buying it, but it's worth it if your machine can handle it. Don't even try to play it without an SSD drive. My brother tried, and it was unplayable. He had long loading screens constantly, and weird bugs. I haven't experienced any of that with an SSD.",Positive
Starfield,1716740,"Product received for freeGot the game from AMD CPU promotion.I really like Bethesda RPGs, I don't know why but I liked their previous games and had a lot of fun on this one as well!Starfield is unique in some cool ways, the main story is kinda lacking yes, but the side questlines are great! The Undercover UC questline is really cool, joining the UC as a captain is also great!I would say that this game shines best with his factions and questlines, side quest and other objectives better then the main quest which is also not bad.",Positive
Starfield,1716740,"This game has all the components required to make my day a little better. Unfortunately the faces of people I meet in the game makes me think they are high on jet fumes and cocaine. Bulging eyes and close talking is making the game a bit weird.Still, a great entertainment.",Positive
Starfield,1716740,"The Game is fun. Reminds me of fallout along with skyrim. I know some people were upset by the ""soft borders"" on planets and honestly I don't mind them. You can still land anywhere on the planets along with I feel that if there were no soft borders the planets could feel overwhelming. I highly recommend this game,",Positive
Starfield,1716740,42 hours and now its crashing bro!!!!!!!,Negative
Starfield,1716740,Very disappointed. Regret preordering this.,Negative
Starfield,1716740,Writing the review in the hopes that BGS makes a chatGPT response. By the way No man's sky is more next gen than Starfield AND it came out on the PS4 and is even on the switch. Why are there so many loading screens and fake loading screens as well? I can skip a loading screen by taking the stairs but taking a elevator somehow forces me into a loading screen. It's almost like Bethesda doesn't know how to animate an elevator.,Negative
Starfield,1716740,"Not a very memorable experience. a lot of fetch quests, and a lot of pointless back and forth traveling quests. I don't recommend buying it at this time.",Negative
Starfield,1716740,"Disappointed all around, only good thing is that it made me watch the expanse which made me dislike it even more.",Negative
Starfield,1716740,"The game is very repetitive. I've had fun with it, but I definitely wouldn't recommend it. Feels like there wasn't much thought put into a lot of the quests - like, why does a 200 year old ship have exactly the same computers and technology as new ships?",Negative
Starfield,1716740,so why cant i adjust my resolution to help with performance no option for full screen the only way round i have found is to set my desktop resolution to 1080p to trick the borderless into lowering it im running on a 3090 and its the only way i can stop the fans spinning up into jet engine mode so i can actually hear the boring dialogue lol i doubt bethesda bot will reply to this one lol,Negative
Starfield,1716740,"I wanted to like this game. I hoped it would be a better Elite Dangerous. Something I could sink my teeth into for hours before a satisfying ending. I can't play this game. Even with enough mods to remake this game, I can't enjoy it.The weapons are all various flavors of vanilla, and with the bullet sponge enemies they all feel like you are flinging farts. An unbearable number of missions involve more loading screens than gameplay. The main quest story is what killed this for me.I say this with as little spoilers as possible, but the main plot is just Rick and Morty.They had all of space to work with, alien discoveries, or space plague to use as a plot... and they chose Rick and Morty BS.Fallout 76 at launch was a better game than this will ever be.",Negative
Starfield,1716740,boring,Negative
Starfield,1716740,A big letdown.I really want the lights game and I'll say to be fair I have a lot of fun with the side content that was actually scripted. I felt looked down by all the repeatable activities and main story felt very boring.  I will play it again but once modders have added some cool stuff.,Negative
Starfield,1716740,Not as good as FO or TES. They try to have the grind of a game like Diablos where you restart getting stronger all the time but the stories are not really engaging.,Negative
Starfield,1716740,Product refundedi had to refund it. game was so slow for me. 19 minutes of gameplay before u make ur name and character... I know i wouldn't have had over 10 hours gameplay if i kept it.,Negative
Starfield,1716740,Product received for freeThe most boring game of the year.,Negative
Starfield,1716740,"Was fun for the first couple of hours but man, it's just a loop.Gameplay once you hit the loop is boring, dull and just not fun.Yes, I can walk around and look at all the big cities, nice graphics and busy towns, but man, its empty of content, easy to cheese, no real feeling of progression and just down right dull.It's like the original Pong game, fun at first until you realise its just the same thing over and over, but hey, look at the graphics!  lol",Negative
Starfield,1716740,Although I like this game I have quests that cant be completed due to bugs especially sabotage quest which was supposed to be fixed in the latest update. new atlantis spaceport is half missing.  An have had bugs from updating ship. And a follower disappeared. Currently re-installing game likely fix nothing.,Negative
Starfield,1716740,"If in doubt go watch a Youtube video.It would take me weeks to write down everything I hate about this game.I can sum up everything I like in one sentence.""Operation Starseed""Never again Todd!Next time I'll set fire to the money instead.If this is the future of gaming, I'm done!",Negative
Starfield,1716740,"Firstly i am enjoying the game,Great Cities and decent side quests. The ship building is cool and having a silent protagonist is so good again.the negative side is the exploration is so boring and bad just a lot of empty places to walk around. Bethesda style games with a one map option like a Morrowind,Skyrim,Fallout 3 and also fallout new vegas are so much more fun to explore. And the games tone in characters is so safe and campy. No crazy mature themes or edgy all the characters seem very soft or written by kids even the crimson fleet. This game makes me miss old fallout mature and cool edgy quests written for mature audience.",Negative
Starfield,1716740,"If you are into random unimportant NPC's trauma dumping on you for hours on end, and if you also enjoy the immersion that 5 loading screens can bring to hundreds of simple fetch quests, then this is the game for you!",Negative
Starfield,1716740,Game is mid TBH.,Negative
Starfield,1716740,the games kinda boring with way too many loading screens,Negative
Starfield,1716740,Meh is really all I can think of regarding this game. Utterly boring,Negative
Starfield,1716740,It was boring,Negative
Starfield,1716740,I have 1200 hours on fallout 4,Negative
Starfield,1716740,Fun but disappointing,Negative
Starfield,1716740,It promised a lot but delivers little. The initial quests were fun but the game quickly becomes repetitive. Basically this is Bethesda's version of No Man's Sky. Boring at best when it was released. Hopefully Bethesda can turn it around the way Hello Games did No Man's Sky. Until then save your money.,Negative
Starfield,1716740,"As a longtime fan of Bethesda and space games, and also RPG's, it pains me to not recommend this game. Unfortunately, all the other reviews stating about how cookie cutter and bland the general act of playing this game is, are true. There are still countless bugs still in the game, that have made my current play-through unplayable.I think the thing that has always made Bethesda games stick out was that there were non limiting in playstyles and existed in lively and beautiful worlds. Starfield is unfortunately the exception to this. The only way you can play is using an assortment of the very bland and non-varried guns.I've tried all of the different quests and found a few quirky little places out exploring, but all in all, it's bleak. I hold out hope for updates and mod support, but as of right now, I would recommend on holding off buying this game.",Negative
Starfield,1716740,How do you make your previous games more interesting in almost every aspect. Just disappointed really.,Negative
Starfield,1716740,"Not what I anticipated. Great concept, but still not there.",Negative
Starfield,1716740,A chore to play...,Negative
Starfield,1716740,the video presentation is not the same as the game.,Negative
Starfield,1716740,"Probably BGS's weakest game since Arena. Bland factions, bland quests, bland characters. Exploration isn't fun or rewarding. Lot's of copy paste locations. Feels like the template of a game that could be, not something fleshed out.It's a bunch of separate gameplay systems looking for a reason to exist. Maybe after some DLC and mod tools it will be worth returning to, but as it stands it's not worth the money.",Negative
Starfield,1716740,"not worth price, gets boring really fast",Negative
Starfield,1716740,To many issues and bugs.  Devs focus on items few care about and ignore issues that people constantly complain about.,Negative
Starfield,1716740,Not the immersive game world of Skyrim or Fallout.What a shame.They prioritised diversity and wokeness over storytelling and worldbuilding and it shows.,Negative
Starfield,1716740,The empty planets suck what little enjoyment is found in the story.,Negative
Starfield,1716740,"After 20 hours I realised that I wasn't having any fun, and at least 5 of those hours was just managing my inventory.  This needs so many QOL patches to make this game not feel like a stocktake shift at work.",Negative
Starfield,1716740,Just unbelievably not fun.,Negative
Starfield,1716740,"Iunno.  I played the hell out of Fallout 3, but every Bethesda game I've tried since I just can't really get hooked on.  This was the same, just... a lot more empty space.  Meh.",Negative

Starfield,1716740,"Some parts of the game are nice. Specifically the quests. But the rest isn't there. No one thing in this game is done to it's peak, or as well as other games who have similar if not the same features. It feels a bit hollow, empty, especially when the worlds and moons sprawl unnecessarily far for what they contain, the nothing to see that they hold can be seen on hundreds of other planets, differing in ways that do not make any unique.",Negative
Starfield,1716740,"This game feels emptier than my bank account post Biden election.Relying on modders to complete the game for you is an embarrassment to the modern day gaming industry. In my 10 hours playing Starfield, it really felt like 9 were navigating the menu, boring dialogue, docking and undocking, and the remaining 1 hour was lifeless combat that quickly finds itself getting repetitive.Save your money, buy a game with some life in it.",Negative
Starfield,1716740,"The more I play it the less I like it, and I can't seem to force myself to go back to it. Good for about 10 hours then it gets boring. None of your choices matter in any way. Procedural generation for worlds and NPC's leaves it feeling hollow. If you've played a BGS game before you know what you are getting into. If you haven't, then I might suggest giving Skyrim a try then see if you want to play a worse game in space.",Negative
Starfield,1716740,"Made me less excited for ES6. I am a lifelong BGS fan but boys, I think it's over. To say Starfield was a disappointment would be putting it very lightly. Cookie cutter, empty planets, loading screens galore, boring NPC's and quests, your choices are mostly irrelevant. I don't think I encountered anything in Starfield that made me care about an outcome one way or the other. Every BGS game since Morrowind has been steadily removing more features and continuing dumbing down. Sad state the video game world is in these days.",Negative
Starfield,1716740,Feels like 2 generations behind.,Negative
Starfield,1716740,Really buggy even a couple of months after launch. Consistently crashing when fast traveling to my ship was the last straw for me. Wait for patches and sales.,Negative
Starfield,1716740,Great scope and vision but ultimately boring. One of the few games I can get up from after an hour of playing and feel like my time could have been much better spent doing something else.,Negative
Starfield,1716740,"I was excited and played the game nonstop for about the first week, after completing the main story there's not that much to do. The end game planets are underutilized and empty beyond belief, while yes you can explore them its the same copy pasted points of interest that get boring to explore after the first 10 hours. I feel as if some of the side missions are much more interesting than the main quest was and new game plus is replaying the same boring story doing the same boring things and there is honestly no need to do it. There are still many quests and game bugs that have yet to be patched that make some missions impossible to complete. You may stumble upon some abandoned ships from time to time while exploring the orbits of the planets but you cant take them, even with max piloting perks for no apparent reason.I do hope the game gets the much needed improvements in the future but for now I would not recommend a purchase of this title, instead just buy skyrim or fallout games with flushed out atmospheres and points of interest that aren't copied and pasted prefabs.",Negative
Starfield,1716740,"Too many quest breaking bugs, Game corruption of not loading key assets. Graphic bugs and Missing textures.This is a real shame. Bethesda could have done something amazing here.  Maybe in a year it will be worth the price.",Negative
Starfield,1716740,this game has caused my hype for TES6 to nosedive into the dirt,Negative
Starfield,1716740,Is not it,Negative
Starfield,1716740,"Honestly, this game is not good. Amazing lack of detail in the world. No maps? Like really no maps and fast travel is awful. A lot of the quests are just walking back and forth.The shooting mechanics is the only thing that is half decent.",Negative
Starfield,1716740,"Put over 90 hours in to my playthrough, and since the last update in November, it crashes guaranteed every time within the first 10 minutes.Very fun game, it's just Space Fallout which is exactly what I was happily expecting, but it's insane that Bethesda can release game after game plagued with crashing problems in this day and age. I can't think of another franchise or game that crashes AT ALL, let alone as regularly as Bethesda's.The game is unplayable as it sits right now with my crashing issues, hopefully they fix that in the next update.",Negative
Starfield,1716740,Picks up after 80 hours.,Negative
Starfield,1716740,This game is buttcheeks,Negative
Starfield,1716740,"While I have over 100 hours in Starfield, you could say I got my ""money's worth"", but looking back I really didn't enjoy it all that much and I can't recommend this game.  Too many aspects are designed to make the game be more tedious than fun, some quick examples being the encumbrance of items and vendors only having enough credits to buy one item from you at a time so you have to sit on a bench and wait three in-game days for their credits to refresh.  So you can either pick up items and end up slow walking through most of the game and spending 45 minutes to vendor it after every quest, or you can ignore picking up items and just be poor, but since credits are so important in this game it just makes no sense to put so many restrictions on looting and selling.  The shipbuilder mode, albeit clunky, was absolutely my favorite part and easily where over half my time went.  It reminded me of building Lego's as a kid, it's just a shame that the actual space exploration and dog-fighting is so poorly utilized and such an underwhelming part of the game.  Shout-out to the modding community for doing their best to fix this game, once I downloaded some mods to iron out all the jank and tedium I started to enjoy it more but in the end it just isn't enough, the game is just too half-baked and ends up being a real slog to play through.   If you have the Bethesda itch you're much better sticking to something like New Vegas or Skyrim.",Negative
Starfield,1716740,I finally did it. I played through the entire game!,Negative
Starfield,1716740,"The game is okay, I guess.However many centuries in the future, colonizing space and you have to walk ---or jet pack everywhere? That make zero sense. I've kind of stopped even flying anywhere, what's the point when you can save yourself three or four load screens and just fast travel. Most recently I have had to stop playing all together because of the you can't save glitch. Good times. The game is meh.",Negative
Starfield,1716740,I have played this game for hundreds of hours. I can take the tedious sidequests or boring characters but the game itself if flawed. I have the most up to date system money can buy and i still get glitches and hitches when aiming down sights. Bugs. All the things we expect but except this time there isnt a great game to cover up the nonsense. Pass.,Negative
Starfield,1716740,"The fundamental gameplay loop of a bethesda game is broken in this game. I can't just walk and walk and keep finding interesting things to do, because there's almost nothing of interest in the whole game.I like subnautica, for example, a game with different gameplay loops that starfield, but even though there is very little intelligent life, there's so much more to do that is rewarding. Why does bethesda still refuse to give us vehicles? there's so much issues in this game of storing resources that you're basically encouraged to not even scavenge resources, because where are you going to put them? Ship is already full, your full, all your companions are full. Can't make a base until late game. Chests barely hold anything. Who made these decisions?Why can't we swim like we could in other bethesda games? Zero gravity has to be kinda similar to swimming, it's just a weird choice.Why are all the companions boring, hate doing interesting things, but also are all trying to date me even though I don't show any interest in them because they are boring? All of these characters are much worse than characters in fallout 4 which had some of my favorite characters in a bethesda game like Cait.Why isn't there a quest involved in the politics of the UC.Why are the pirates just bad guys? A good bad guy should think they are the good guy at least. It seems pretty obvious the UC has done a lot of bad stuff, so it should be pretty easy to write that group as opposed to the UC's bad stuff. Fine, you don't want the pirates to be freedom fighters, well then let me join a faction that is freedom fighters.Why aren't their big dungeons or caves that are interesting? Put a golden claw in somewhere or give me a vault to explore where they did experiments. All the caves are basically empty mining passages where alien bugs took over. That's fine, but it gets repetitive.I don't usually review games, but after I saw that bethesda was responding to these reviews I was hoping some unpaid intern somewhere might at least read this and pass some of these comments back.boring game and ultimately I'm less excited for elder scrolls now and I've been waiting for a third of my life for the next one.",Negative
Starfield,1716740,"Quests are boring. The main story isn't that interesting. Man, I feel like this game is huge, but with very little to offer. I feel like it's missing that magic that Skyrim has.",Negative
Starfield,1716740,Incomplete and bland.,Negative
Starfield,1716740,Easily the worst Bethesda SP game for pc.,Negative
Starfield,1716740,"I like this game because I like Bethesda's game style. As fallout 76 is a bad online game, Starfield is like a substitution. This game is no bad but it just like a tasteless fallout game in space. There is almost nothing special in this game except ship building. The is nothing like V.A.T.S. from fallout which is unique or new.The main story line make you stop building a permanent base UNTIL you spend a huge amount of time literally repeating the game, if you want to max you level. THIS stop me playing this game when I found out. In fallout 4 they introduce base building and people build creative stuff and player could spend a huge amount of time having fun. Now it is like you need to spend a huge amount of time to have fun. WHY? I don't understand why they would HINDERING one of the selling point of Bethesda's game featuring.I hope they would create a DLC which bring more unique feature to this game. This game need an overhaul.",Negative
Starfield,1716740,"Boring, empty, bad writing, uninteresting characters, and way, way too many copy and pasted assets. This whole game is basically the same 30 props used over and over for every dungeon. Fallout reuses assets too but at least the world was detailed enough to feel original unlike Starfield. Also the gas lighting Bethesda is doing in this review section by trying to tell you how you experienced the game is wrong, it's just pathetic. Your big flagship game that you over hyped flopped hard, and now you're trying to tell people who didn't like the game that you know best and that the fans are wrong because big daddy Microsoft might come after you. You look like clowns.",Negative
Starfield,1716740,"In essence, Skyrim in space. Says it does everything but does little in anything.Is that enough in 2023? No.And yes, mods will be the only thing keeping Starfield alive going fourth.",Negative
Starfield,1716740,"The most boring game ever made. It's cool for a few hours, but quickly devolves into the same grey nightmare.  Great concept, total nothing burger.",Negative
Starfield,1716740,"I played for nearly 90 hours and I got bored. Unlike Skyrim and other Bethesda games, the adventures get boring, the companions are pretty much the same, and there's no factions that have an impact on the game world. Finally, the lack of decent maps and not having any vehicles to travel around a planet's surface is a huge miss.",Negative
Starfield,1716740,"Do you want to explore an untamed universe? Do you want to experience cultures that have developed separately into their own distinct people with the influence of the environments they've settled? Do you want to go raiding and pillaging with your space pirate crew? Do you want to explore interesting planets? Do you want to prepare for dangerous hazards of a hostile alien planet? Do you want a challenge? Or do you just want to experience an interesting story?Well this isn't the game for you.You'll be jumping around with loading screens through disconnected bubbles where there's not much to be found, running into the same NPCs over and over again. You get to experience bland 21st century Americanized monoculture all across the galaxy with very little if any distinction even between factions which supposedly hate each other. Almost every NPC in the game is lawful-good and will hate you for any even morally grey decision making. The planets and dungeons on them are cookie cutter, which was expected, but not tastefully done. The procedural generation is bare bones and the AI of alien creatures is laughably basic. Don't expect to find any massive kaiji-esque creatures, either. I don't think I encountered anything any bigger than an Elephant or Giraffe. Doesn't matter how cold, hot, radioactive, toxic, etc a planet is. So long as you don't face two hazards at once, any suit will keep you safe. The game is dead easy, especially with some of the random look. I found an incendiary sniper rifle that does double damage to targets with full HP and already has ridiculously high base damage as random loot. The story is uninteresting, as well. I've never actually gotten bored with a Bethesda main quest and gave up on it before. You have very little player choice, the NPCs you are meant to interact with are generic cookie cutter monoculture lawful-goods, and it's yet another chosen one story.You'll have a more complete experience by playing Star Explorers. This is perhaps Bethesda's worst RPG to date.",Negative
Starfield,1716740,"Fun game. I enjoyed exploring planets, setting up outposts, gaining skills and cool equipment, and killing bad guys. But it still has WAY too many bugs. Bugged quests were filling up my quest list, and then I reached a point in the main quest where I simply can not play anymore. I'm stuck drifting in space.I'm tired of reloading old save games to try to find a point where I can do... something.Maybe in a year or two when they work out some of the bugs?",Negative
Starfield,1716740,At first I really enjoyed the game but the more I play it the boring it gets. I fell asleep so many time while the NPC was just talking about space politics.,Negative
Starfield,1716740,No. I just came here for the free ChatGPT generated Gaslighting and cake.,Negative
Starfield,1716740,"I wouldn't recommend buying this game. The exploration is boring, no terrestrial body I landed on left me feeling like I was the first person to land there, as they all seemed to have human structures on the surface. Plus a lot of landmarks were anything up to 2 km away which you could only get to on foot. You would often run into the same structures on multiple planets and moons, with often the same enemies.  The quests were OK, but a lot were randomly generated and would just repeat over and over again which became very boring. The constellation companions morals are all the same which makes choosing which one to pick almost pointless. The mod support is poor, half the mods have issues, you'd be better off playing Skyrim its a much better game. Overall there are better space simulation  games available then this. If you really want to try it wait for a sale.",Negative

Starfield,1716740,"A 2005 game at for 2023 prices. Old engine and it is showing.I guess the game would be fine for your 12 year old kid or someone new to video games. But as someone who has played the most of them, this does not impress or exite what so ever.",Negative
Starfield,1716740,"Man this game is really bad. I cannot even get through the first ""kill rats in the stable masters shed"" mission. Its reeks of the same game made over and over and over and over. Inventory system is horrific. Combat is dull. NPCs are just voids. Menus upon menus. And I honestly do not want the option to pick up every single coffee cup in the place. Space combat is TERRIBLE.",Negative
Starfield,1716740,"Look, it's not a bad game. But to be fair, it's not a good to great game either.  I would say that it's average and you will get some time out of it before eventually getting bored and moving on. Parts of it are tedious, the story feels disjointed and your choices don't matter as much as they should.  This does not lead to immersion or a memorable experience..... On top of the thousands of loading screen.You want to know what is a great recent RPG?  Baldurs gate 3. The world is alive around you and the freedom you have is incomparable to anything.  I had it in my library while I was playing starfield and thought I will try it out for an hour.......couldn't bring myself to go back to Starfield after that. Bg3, unfortunately, illustrated clearly what was missing in Starfield.

Starfield,1716740,Writing the review in the hopes that BGS makes a chatGPT response. By the way No man's sky is more next gen than Starfield AND it came out on the PS4 and is even on the switch. Why are there so many loading screens and fake loading screens as well? I can skip a loading screen by taking the stairs but taking a elevator somehow forces me into a loading screen. It's almost like Bethesda doesn't know how to animate an elevator.,Negative

Starfield,1716740,"The game is very repetitive. I've had fun with it, but I definitely wouldn't recommend it. Feels like there wasn't much thought put into a lot of the quests - like, why does a 200 year old ship have exactly the same computers and technology as new ships?",Negative
Starfield,1716740,so why cant i adjust my resolution to help with performance no option for full screen the only way round i have found is to set my desktop resolution to 1080p to trick the borderless into lowering it im running on a 3090 and its the only way i can stop the fans spinning up into jet engine mode so i can actually hear the boring dialogue lol i doubt bethesda bot will reply to this one lol,Negative
Starfield,1716740,"I wanted to like this game. I hoped it would be a better Elite Dangerous. Something I could sink my teeth into for hours before a satisfying ending. I can't play this game. Even with enough mods to remake this game, I can't enjoy it.The weapons are all various flavors of vanilla, and with the bullet sponge enemies they all feel like you are flinging farts. An unbearable number of missions involve more loading screens than gameplay. The main quest story is what killed this for me.I say this with as little spoilers as possible, but the main plot is just Rick and Morty.They had all of space to work with, alien discoveries, or space plague to use as a plot... and they chose Rick and Morty BS.Fallout 76 at launch was a better game than this will ever be.",Negative

Diablo® IV,2344520,It's an ok Diablo hack and slash with some fun stories and loot drops. The lack of summoning builds is a little lame but it's fun.However the biggest issue is the always online requirement. Servers are unstable even years after the games release. There are often hours where you can't play or even know if the servers are back up. Just replay the older Diablo games or do another PoE run instead of giving Blizzard your money.,Negative
Diablo® IV,2344520,"Dreadfully boring campaign, empty world, uninteresting story that feels heavily recycled.Combat mechanics are very basic for an ARPG, the tree is very straightforward and doesn't offer much, and the bosses are mind-numbingly easy.

It's basically diablo 2 and 3 mix but with a lot of nerf.  The storyline is really good which is the only good thing.I'm big fan of blizzard game I played played diablo 2 and 3 and I play wow warcraft 3After playing diablo 4 I like to say I'm not buying diablo 5 they ruined the game.",Negative

I contact support they ask me questions like when I buy some in diablo, bills of payment, when I buy deck in hearthstone, how my character name in wow and similar nonsense, who remember that after 10 years??? Nothing fix and all my games from blizzard lost because their mistakes. On bottom line I will NEVER buy anything from Blizzard!!!",Negative
Diablo® IV,2344520,"I don't hate Diablo IV, in fact I think its a moderately fun game. What I don't like about it is the need to be constantly connected to the internet which kills playing it on Steam Deck since you can not suspend the game without being stuck in reconnecting forever or just straight up booted from the game. Maybe if the reconnecting actually worked this wouldn't be a big deal but as is - you have to manually close out of the game and lose any progress you made. Not sure how that consider this Verified for Steam Deck. Additionally the constant pushing of DLC and seasons and the leveling experience this time around are not great either.I do enjoy the look and sound of it and can be fun to play on PC or Steam Deck but its unfortunate that they have chained this game to a micro transaction MMO model that is commonly seen on free to play games. If they ever give the option to play offline like with Diablo 3 I will change me review.",Negative

Assassin's Creed Valhalla,2208920,"One of the best Assassin's Creed games in my opinion. However, it should have been called Viking's Creed or something different because you're not an assassin, you're a brutal murderer in this game.This game is so rich with content that it is overwhelming. I didn't think it was possible to make a game too good, but this is what has happened here.The combat is superb in my opinion, although at first, I didn't like it. I couldn't get used to not being able to hold down the right trigger for a built-up power swing, but instead gaining access to skills. I'm used to this now, and I really do enjoy it. The gore and bloody finishing scenes with dismemberment are perfect for me - I just wish there were more of them because they are satisfying.The scenery is very pleasing to the eye. The environments created in this game, combined with the weather is beautiful. Some of snowy areas in this game seem to really capture that cold, dark, frosty look.I will never be able to fully complete this game. It would take a very long time indeed. I always find myself coming back to it now and then to progress a little further. It's a flawed gem I think. Credit to the devs working on this, though. It must have taken a lot of effort.",Positive

The weird clunky crafting and upgrading system did not impress me, but by itself thats not enough to kill my enjoyment. Mostly its the annoying combat and climbing mechanics.

Assassin's Creed Valhalla,2208920,"I definitely do not recommend it. There is no problem when playing with my 16 GB graphics card, but unfortunately the game either does not open or constantly crashes. It keeps the menus waiting for about 2 days. I worked for 1 week and read a lot of resources about this problem, but it still did not fix it. I think people have been working on this issue for 3-4 years, but they cannot get any results. Is the game good? It's hard to understand because it's not playable. Not to mention the problems and ruptures between Ubisoft and Steam. Unfortunately, it is obvious that no effort has been made on this issue and the problem has continued for years. I say this as someone who has bought almost all AC games. I messed around with my computer so much that it started to cause psychological damage to me. I deleted the game and now I'm trying to get used to my computer again by spending time playing other games. If I had known that returns would be accepted, I would have, but it was too late. I am someone who has never refunded a game in my life and I would do this.",Negative
Assassin's Creed Valhalla,2208920,"Regular crashes ruin the experience. Tedious grinding for resources makes the game a chore and combat is cumbersome and often unsatisfying.

Assassin's Creed Valhalla,2208920,"Game crashes every once in awhile. That isn't that bad on its own, but the game takes so long to tell its story, introduce its characters, and have you run place to place across a vast empty land, that any time it does crash just feels like a fantastic opportunity to put the game down.I have had a lukewarm reception to this game, and it's been... hard to justify playing it when I could get equal entertainment from free youtube videos.

Assassin's Creed Valhalla,2208920,"A disappointment to the Assassin's Creed series, even by the standards of their recent games. Initially, I'm annoyed by the lack of steam achievements, which the previous games have had.The combat cinematic are repetitive, and way less smooth than any previous game, which really sets a new low for the franchise. Though I can't put my finger on it, the general movement and climbing also feels very clunky. The intro to the game was breaking new barriers... for how boring it was. To top it off, it felt very devoid of emotion. Maybe they wanted a stoic viking, but that doesn't help me connect with the character.I've known Assassin's Creed to be the franchise to go to when you want a cinematic combat experience, but this game really shows how much they've strayed from that. Syndicate was the last game for good cinematic combat, and Black Flag was the last game for good story and atmosphere. Every game since Black Flag almost seems to be competing to be a bigger joke than the last.",Negative
Assassin's Creed Valhalla,2208920,Not a great game for people who have played AC games in the past.1. Map is insanely large with repetitive side quests2. Characters are not likable3.

Assassin's Creed Valhalla,2208920,"The game is a huge waste of time. I really tried giving it a shot but after 70 hours I am done. The game is really bad in every aspect. The ""Assassins Creed"" from the game is missing. Its just a generic mobile game ad level RPG with a Assassins creed brand on it. Even if you take away the Assassins creed name the game does not hold up well on its own at all.For Example,There are 100 types of enemies but they all have only one or two attack animations that they constantly spam. That sums up the entirely of this game's combat, there is nothing more to it.If all that is not enough the steam version does this funny thing of crashing out to the desktop everytime the game tries to synchronise achievements which is 20-30 minutes but guess what? they didnt even bother adding steam achievements but the game has the logic programmed in it to do so and then crashes out when it cannot sync with steam.",Negative
Assassin's Creed Valhalla,2208920,"Assassin's Creed Valhalla, with its Viking warrior setting, represents a departure from the series' traditional formula. As a fan of previous AC games, I found it didn't quite capture the same magic. While the story and characters remained strong, the game lacked the deep connection to the Assassins vs. Templar conflict. Valhalla feels more like a Viking saga with AC elements, which might not suit fans of the older formula. It's enjoyable for those interested in the Viking era but left me longing for the traditional AC experience.",Negative

Assassin's Creed Valhalla,2208920,The game looks amazing the story looks promising. I like the AC games because they go the extra mile in the architecture and history.Regarding the stability of the game... it is a complete disaster. The game crashes with no error showing. I looked at the forums and it seems that this is very common. The support is non existing. After sending them all the files they needed you get nothing.I wanted to buy the game with al the dlc included... I am happy I didn't.O and it will start crashing after 12h of gameplay.

At 1st the game seemed promising, the idea of pillaging villages, running wild and free and conquering land and resources seemed pretty fun. But having said that, It was very painful to finish the main campaign. The Game is so extremely repetitive and boring after a while. Countless cut scenes and dialogues that lead to nothing. The main objectives are basically exactly the same, every time you finish the previous one. Sometimes when I was bored of the campaign I'd just load the game, find a lake and go fishing for hours.

When ever this happens the game crashes to desktop. It varies sometimes happening every 10 - 20 mins sometimes happening after an hour of game time. It's extremely annoying especially since there are tons and tons of forum posts online about this problem and reaching out to support is of no help since they refuse to admit that the problem is on there end and that they are working on a fix.Until this problem gets fixed I would not advise getting this game on Steam, unless you can handle the game crashing every 10 - 20 mins on you.",Negative

Fallout 76,1151340,"Simply a Fallout 4 online in West Virginia mountains, fun game with amazingly friendly playerbase. Right outside vault 76, when you start the game, there were two high levels in power armor, they gave me any supplies I could use then, and they escorted me to the Wayward. There are frequent themed updates so the game stays pretty fresh. Highly recommend this game",Positive
Fallout 76,1151340,"I've enjoyed the past Fallout Games.  Each one has it's own feel to it.  If you play normally, it honestly does feel like exploring the wasteland.  If you pay the subscription, you can go from super hard to casual mode.  It gives you the chance to build your camp.  Explore the game.. Then in a flick of a switch you can have a very challenging exploration.  I don't know why people complain about subscription.  You never have to see those people.  You have a choice of public servers or your own server with friends without worrying if someone is farming your quest areas.  Some days I dont want to go full hardcore and dodging bullets and juggling resources.  Sometimes I want to just build my camp like giant lego blocks and enjoy the scenery.  Don't let people tell you how to play your game.  It's your money.",Positive

Fallout 76,1151340,"Gave FO76 a try again during the double XP weekend. The game is really fun! Once I got past level 50 everything opens up and gets really addicting especially making builds and trying to get legendary weapons and armor. Story quests are okay. It feels like FO4 running around doing NPC's errands.The community is wonderful though and I think it's why I really stuck around this time. When I was really low level, a lot of high level players just drop tons of stimpacks, water, plans, weapons, and radaway to help me on my journey. They also helped me during public events with tagging and reviving me with Stimpacks. Everyone is really wholesome. Game feels like the usual modern Fallout games, only to run into a player every so often. Nothing really happens and people just wave at you and go on their way.Camp building gets goofy though. It's a bit buggy but I googled some workarounds and tips to make my camp stuff. If you liked Fallout 4 settlements, FO76 has a similar system.The game is decently generous with atoms now too. The dailies and weeklies aren't too challenging and you get a lot of free stuff from the scoreboard every season.I encourage people to give it a try, especially if they stopped playing around launch time. Do try to get it on sale, as the game gets heavily discounted at that time.",Positive

This memory is so bad my brain is physically rejecting it and now I have a headache every time I think about it. Why did you create this, thinking it was a good idea? You've permanently ruined my life because of this, I hope you're happy. I hope that one day this gets branded as a war crime and you get hauled off to prison, never to see the light of day again. The fact that you're already not in a psych ward for insanity is so baffling I have lost all faith in every kind of justice system.

The events are garbage and while your character can level up into the thousands, gear completely stops levelling at 50, and you will hit this cap very quickly and stagnate.

I tried reinstalling the game, and after multiple crashes during character creation, I was able to start a new game.

Still I refuse to give a proper review since I am just annoyed by the game starting updates whenever it wants even though I've set steam to not do updates without my permission. Furthermore the update process on this game works just very poorly. So from a technical aspect this game is a total no-go!,Negative
Baldur's Gate 3,1086940,"I have a few hours in the gameI would not recommend this game if you are playing with friends that are not om the same platform as you though.So many hours wasted and so many scheduled sessions having to be canceled at the last moment because of this.Larian can't figure out how to keep the same updates on all platforms, even though they pride themselves on being a co-op game",Negative

Baldur's Gate 3,1086940,Frustrating.,Negative
Baldur's Gate 3,1086940,I bought this game with my friend. We can never play it. Every time we go to play there is a new 6 hour update.Its already 120gb and it needs 26 gb patches that take hours to install? Every week. Go away.,Negative

Baldur's Gate 3,1086940,this would be a good game if it didnt crash every 20 minutes,Negative
Baldur's Gate 3,1086940,"This is gonna be a hard one. I'm about 520 hours into this game and done many playthroughs. The release of this game, and the quality at release was AMAZING. This game absolutely blew me out of the water like literally no game ever has, or ever will again. The story, sheer amount of detail, and character romance stories are unparalleled  by anything that has come before, and the immersion was as well before the last update. The combat was also innovative and incredible. However, due to the damage of the last two updates, I can only recommend that people save their money and not bother for a long while. The last update before today broke the combat and made act 3 virtually unplayable, with the party freezing and you being unable to interact with anything for anyone for anywhere between 5 and 20 minutes, and this would happen every 10 yards if travel, often even less. And mind you this is with a badass PC and no mods. Making choices throughout the game was proven to slow down performance, and that speaks to a much deeper problem with the game's design that must be fixed before it will be worth playing again. Today's update completely destroyed the game. Any attempt to play the game- whether trying to load an old game or start a new one- will result in an immediate crash to desktop. I've tried reinstalling the game and nothing has worked. After how much I grew to love this game over the first 350 hours of gameplay, this is devastating and hurtfull, as well how insulting the last 150 hours felt with the game being broken from the last update. I hope one day the devs will figure out what the hell theyre doing, because I've never seen a game go from amazing to unplayable, only the other way around. Save your money and dont buy this until it's fixed. If they can ever restore the game to its former glory, I'll change my review. But dont waste your time and money on this just yet if you haven't already",Negative
Baldur's Gate 3,1086940,The game is fun enough until you get to ACT 3.  OMG the game is almost unplayable.  The loading lags are minutes long to take a few steps.  In it's current state i can't recommend it.  There's no reason this game was released with this kind of bug.  How is this GoTY material?!,Negative
Baldur's Gate 3,1086940,The game is broken and full of bugs on PC and PS5.  The latest patch made the game unplayable.  Save your money until Larian Studios decides to fix it.,Negative
Baldur's Gate 3,1086940,"Game crashes my Computer after 30minutes of play time. Looked online for help, its been happening to hundreds of people. We need a fix for this. Would be a great game if not for this issue hope they fix it soon",Negative
Baldur's Gate 3,1086940,Baldur's Gate lll is just not my cup of tea.,Negative
Baldur's Gate 3,1086940,"Glaring game design flaws keep this game from really standing out. The puzzles make sense to only the game designers who created them, zapping any aspect of challenging fun. They are boring and nonsensical, and you have to google the intricate details on how to solve them, really zaps the fun out. It shouldn't be that way.The narrator voice is absolutely horrid. She's sounds like a poor combination of trying to be dramatic in a sort of whisperer pillow talk kind of way. It is painful to listen to. I have come to just manually mute whenever she speaks since there is no other option. Such a shame because the rest of the voice acting is good with the characters.",Negative
Baldur's Gate 3,1086940,"very over-hyped. combat is tedious, leveling and gameplay is very boring. I was promised anal devastating action but its just a bunch of squid people doing tentacle stuff and turn based combat. writing is mid. makes for an excellent sleep aide.",Negative
Baldur's Gate 3,1086940,"Personally, I'm having trouble staying interested in BG3. I know I might be in the minority here, but so far, the storyline doesn't hook me in and I really don't care for the turn-based combat. I know it's DnD, but I guess I just like live action in my video games over the turn-based.  Otherwise, it looks like a great game. I'll probably keep trying to play it though, just to see if it grows on me.",Negative
Baldur's Gate 3,1086940,"Have to give a negative review because I cant give a middling. The difficulty gets to be frustrating, losing half a health bar after two attacks on the explorer mode is too much. If I choose story I don't want combat.  I should have seen this coming from DOS2. The story and characters seem good so far but I may never know because I am stuck.",Negative
Baldur's Gate 3,1086940,This game is just like having intercourse with a Succubus Act 1 and 2 are amazing and fun best feeling in your life and then you enter act 3 instantly soul sucked out of your body and life force and will power to continue is immediatley goneBasically act 1 and 2 really fun and worth your money while act 3 is the biggest miyazaki swamp in terms of how it feels to play it,Negative
Baldur's Gate 3,1086940,To much woke in this game. I regret that I bought it. Pathfinder Wraith of the Righteous is a much better game on all fronts.,Negative
Baldur's Gate 3,1086940,Woke as hell.,Negative
Baldur's Gate 3,1086940,This game is unplayable. The entire battle system is based on a limited amount of moves that can only be used one time. After that you just use regular attacks. Fights are few and far between so leveling up on low level fights isn't an option. Most of the story is a third person narrative that gets old extremely fast. i don't know how this game got so many good reviews. I would get a return but it took me 11 hours to realized that it wasn't getting better. I'm definitely not buying a digital only game again. At least with a physical copy i could trade it in or something. Huge waste of time and money.,Negative

Baldur's Gate 3,1086940,"I really want to enjoy this game, but after having played several other TTRPG systems, I just don't find 5e's design enjoyable. That said, the characters are very well written and the developers did a great job making the narrative feel dynamic.",Negative
Baldur's Gate 3,1086940,"At first, I bought the game not realizing that it was just the beta. Once I got the full version, despite game stats indicating that it should run on my Mac it runs slow and choppy  and I have had to reinstall after the most recent patch-- it is unbearably slow to load and run-- I was so excited about this game but it is not worth running on a MAC",Negative

Baldur's Gate 3,1086940,This is game is hard to play. And there were no tutorials to help with the basics. Very hard for beginners.,Negative
Baldur's Gate 3,1086940,"BGS is a game that focus's on gender and identity politics, under the guise of table top rpg elements with an agenda to slowly move those not infected and in hopes its perverse ideals take root. There are three types of players involved into this, people who are aware and reject its wokness and politics, people who are too naive to know the differences and people who support the mental cancers that this game push's.This is the foundation of the game and those that speak of its qualities falls under those three.With that, I am disappointed in this move but not surprised. Its not the baldur's gate that the real fans wanted, but the one we deserve in a sense cause of our weaknesses to point out the sickness that growing in society, letting it spread.",Negative
Baldur's Gate 3,1086940,"The first two acts are excellent, where passion and expertise manage to shine through. The third act fumbles what came before. It's evident that the final acts lies unfinished and rushed. Much of the side content and characters don't receive conclusions or resolutions. The writing suffers the most. Certain character's actions at one of the endings are illogical. Imagine if William Wallace decided to accept king's pardon and proceeded to join him. The complete betrayal of an established character's motivations.I'll leave a negative review for the time being because of the final act's drop in quality. The review will update if the game gets polished, improved and expanded, as was promised by Larian.This is not to say that the whole of the game is bad or that it's not worth playing. Few developers remain who show respect for their audience's time and investment.",Negative

Walk 5 feet game freezes and you have to wait 10 minutes for it to load. Walk another 5 feet wait another 10 minutes. If you are unlucky the game will just outright crash loosing all of your walking progress and you will have to do the same song and dance again. I would love to recommend this game.

The game is quite packed with content and activities, yet it manages to keep a relaxed vibe without overwhelming you.The core loop involving diving for ingredients, managing your restaurant, and progressing through the game in a role-play fashion is rather engaging. I found myself more invested in it than in most roguelites.I decided to share my thoughts after completing the game, and I can genuinely give it a warm recommendation.

I typically like games where there is a lot of exploring, crafting, and management, and this game scratches all those itches while still being super casual which I like. Dying is not a disaster. Missions can be failed and tried again at no cost to the player. It's just an all-around great experience. Great job devs!",Positive

DAVE THE DIVER,1868140,"Dave the Diver is joy to play, at least, it is until you make it to the end game. The storyline is cute and well-thought out and the mechanics are pretty front loaded, allowing you to get a good feel for the game quickly and start working your way through the game-play loop. There isn't much challenge to the game, and that's alright, the overall vibe, play and art style all lend itself to a comfy game time with little to stress a player.  This would definitely be a recommendation I'd put out for getting a pre-teen or early teenager into gaming.The controls of the game are tight, its easy to understand and the games advancement and upgrading is all very linear. Only the guns offer any sort of ""hunt down x"" that can get annoying, but even then, its not hard to figure out.I really have few complaints about the game, but they all have to deal with the ""post-game"" so to speak, so they don't really detract from the base game, which is a polished gem.Complaint 1.The ""Cooking Mama"" Mini-Games that pop up towards the end of the game really come out of left field, and feel unpolished in comparison to the rest of the game. They aren't bad, but I also don't feel anything would have been lost by just excluding them.Complaint 2.Dives start to take excessively long and become very repetitive post game and even leading into the post game. A ""good dive"" can typically end up being close to an hour or longer a pop. Which when there is incentive to go after the same fish every dive, it can feel very samey, very quickly and all the polish loses its luster.Complaint 3.After the story is completed, there's not a whole lot to do anymore aside from maybe 1 or 2 bosses, depending on how quickly you progressed, and just running bancho sushi. But when the vast majority of the game is spent on dives, it becomes disappointing that there aren't anymore surprises, its just achievement hunting. This can be especially troubling when its possible to demolish the game without much in the way of gun upgrades, and a staff that's only a quarter or slightly more leveled.  After that, it just makes things even easier.All in all though, I still adore the game and plan to get all the achievements before retiring it.",Positive

DAVE THE DIVER,1868140,"Dave the Diver"" delivers a captivating gaming experience where relaxation meets underwater exploration. Set near a picturesque seaside restaurant, the game impresses with its breathtaking ocean exploration and the integration of underwater challenges. The game's strength lies in the idea of exploring the ocean beyond familiar shores, bringing a sense of tranquility and beauty. Players face unexpected underwater challenges, keeping them engaged and providing a sense of accomplishment. The integration of fantastical elements, such as mermaids and their underwater village, adds a charming touch. Exceptional animations contribute to creating a remarkable visual atmosphere.

There is a lot of heart put in making this game, and the variety of gameplay elements and new content that tries to keep the experience fresh must be applauded. Even the closing credits are fun.

DAVE THE DIVER,1868140,"Dave The Diver is a fun, wholesome, and relaxing game that I view as a nice palate cleanser. In that this can be something you can play if you are trying to wash out the taste of a bad game you've played out of your mouth or if you just want to play something a little more simple and just relax.You can definitely tell that the developers put a lot of love into making this game and had some making it with its charming pixel art, chill soundtrack and a bit of quirky humor in between.The story feels like it's really just there for the sake of progression. Which is fine since it serves its purpose for what it's trying to do, but that's just it, it doesn't really stick with you. There are some points in the story where it does feel a little sluggish, but overall it has kept things interesting by steadily introducing new mechanics as you progress.Overall, I would say this a game that is worth picking just have something sit down, relax, and play.

The list of things I don't like is far outweighed by the time I've spent exploring the ocean and diving too greedily and too deep.Well worth the investment. Solid game.",Positive
DAVE THE DIVER,1868140,"Stardew Valley meets Raft? This game is engrossing and adorable. The plot is unique and keeps me interested. I personally find the cooking game challenging. The music is a vibe. If you like collecting achievements, this game is probably for you.",Positive

A few too many game systems that aren't really necessary or well fleshed out, even some of the core systems like running the sushi restaurant seem like they needed more polish to be fun and balanced.It's a really charming game but far from perfect.",Negative
DAVE THE DIVER,1868140,"It's pretty good at first, but overall it's just kinda boring. It doesn't really challenge you in any way except for the boss fights. It gets very repetitive exploring the same areas to reach whatever minor plot point you're at in the story. It's sorta structured like an rpg, but there's barely anything to really work towards that isn't directly tied to the plot.

DAVE THE DIVER,1868140,It's kinda tedious,Negative
DAVE THE DIVER,1868140,"Basically there are 2 phases in the core gameplay loop - the fish catching phase and the restaurant phase where you cook and sell the fish.15 hours in I couldn't find a point where the restaurant phase becomes fun, the only engaging part of the phase is actually the drink minigames which can also be done by NPCs automatically, this phase may as well have a SKIP button. The only challenging part is where you sort the fish by price and add just enough fish to the menu for the night.The biggest problem with the fishing phase is the content bloat. There are so many different types of fish depending on the time of day and the depth, however most of them don't serve an apparent purpose, catching low value fish is almost always worse than catching bigger and expensive fish. The fish within the same price range don't have a unique identity, basically catch whatever fish is the most expensive and available, no reason to have variety in the menu, the customers gobble up whatever you're selling.Very often while playing I'm asking myself ""Why am I even doing this?"". I'm catching fish to sell at the restaurant but it doesn't matter what fish I catch as long as it's the most expensive fish, and I'm selling my fish at the restaurant so I can make money to afford the upgrades I need to catch even more expensive fish and to also automate the core gameplay loop. The answer is the story - it is pretty good and the characters are very interesting and unique, so I just catch enough fish to afford upgrades just enough to comfortably progress the story.Overall, this game looks good from the outside but it has a flawed design and the devs are just adding more bloat instead of addressing the issue. Not the first game to cover up its flaws with more content so it's not that big of a deal but still can't recommend this, wait for a big sale to try it out.",Negative

DAVE THE DIVER,1868140,"The game has a ton of great ideas but it is a massive killjoy in my opinion and leaves me asking ""do I enjoy this game or do I slog through the game to get the things I enjoy?"".The pacing of this game is pretty bad. I am constantly inundated with forced tutorials that I really don't need, forced into or out of the ocean when I had other plans for progression, or weirdly held back from upgrading things because I haven't waded through said forced content.DAVE THE DIVER, as the title insists, has very limited game mechanics. This isn't even a bad thing really, I think it says a lot that the game is so popular and enjoyable with such limited mechanics. That is not to say that there is not much to do, just that the core gameplay is effectively just a handful of the same actions in different flavors. So it is a good game to chill out wi.....................except whoops you died so whatever you just did was meaningless. I could use an autosave every once in a while in the ocean especially in this ADHD format.I really like the restaurant stuff, in fact I would love to run the restaurant and use the diving to fuel it for the most part. Instead the restaurant comes and goes with the haste of an underpaid escort while you are thrust back into the ocean to do the same few things again for the billionth time. Oh god why am I already tired of diving in a game about diving?The game is obviously well done but I just find myself being more unhappy than happy so I don't need to force myself through the remainder. If you choose to buy this game I hope you enjoy it, but I just feel annoyed more than anything else.",Negative

DAVE THE DIVER,1868140,"The game was so fun at the start when I was just catching fish and running the restaurant but the devs try to make this game so boring for some reason. So many ""tasks"" that you have to complete are you just holding spacebar and carrying an object underwater from point A to point B, no challenge, no fun just tedium.There's an underwater fish people village that you visit early on and while that sounds really cool it is one of the most boring parts of the game. The villager quests are so boring and uninspired once again consisting of the same hold space here and move to here mechanics.A good example of the devs realizing how slow this game is yet doing nothing about it also happens in that village. In the underwater village you move so slowly and the village is massive, simply crossing across it is a 2 minute excursion. The devs must have realized that because they added a underwater taxi that you can ride only in that village, except it triggers a cut scene each time you summon it, it disappears whenever you go into any building and it uses that villages exclusive currency each time you summon it again. Thereby making even the fast travel slow and punishing.Can't wait for the sequel to this game where you manage a paint drying business.",Negative

I've never got more than 2 games in a row without my PC blue screening or locking up so that i had to manually power cycle it with the button on my case.

Well look no further, with BF2042's patented technology it just magically knows when you need a break and will force you to stop playing and take that much needed black screen break. Need a snack, a drink or even a much needed pee break? Well this game has you covered with those frequent black screen breaks. What's that you say? You need an excuse to get off because your teammates are trash! Well no worries friend, Black screen has you covered. No more need for lying to your friends just because you want to go to bed.

Battlefield 2042,1517290,"One of the worst FPS games I have ever played in my life time. Does not at all have that Battlefield game feel. Too fast paced. Nothing is tactical about it what so ever. Maps are very poorly designed. Servers are full of bots and XP farms. Weapons feel like plastic. Graphics are terrible and of course, poor optimization for PC.Couldn't get any worse for EA.",Negative
Battlefield 2042,1517290,"as much as i'd like to recommend it, i cant. I've experienced more bugs in 4 hours playtime than any other game i've played. invisible weapons, game freezing and crashing are the main ones. then you have the gameplay. while it can be very fun, its not great. youve got campers insta killing you upon spawning because for SOME REASON there is no invincibility period after you spawn. Most infantry anti vehicle weapons are literally useless against planes, especially that one specialists rocket cause it moves slower than the HELICOPTERS. to be honest theyre even bad against ground vehicles too, cause you will ALWAYS need more than one rocket to take down a tank, which by then you'll be dead from either the same tank or a guy on foot. Theres also the issue of basically every weapon being useless except assault rifles, but that may just be a skill issue on my end. This game could've been great, but alas it isnt. If EA and dice could somehow balance infantry combat, fix the bugs and ADD AN INVINCIBILITY PERIOD, it would be at least 5x better. In its current state i just cannot recommend this, even if it can be fun.",Negative
Battlefield 2042,1517290,"The game is good! Realy are! Of course if it can run on your's PC! Or if it able to connect on servers. For now this battlefield is not bad, even after that terrable release!However, I can't connect to servers, and I can't fix it for 3 days! I just playing like a 10 minutes and then - connect lost, and next each 2 minutes is crashing! So I would recommend try it on EA Play, or on free-weekend. If it work on PC of your's - you're lucky! But if game is crashing - refund it, because it's can't fix in easy ways! At least I can't found solution. I played it before on PS5, and it not bad! But on PC it's just can't running.

Football Manager 2024,2252570,"This is basically just FM23 which was an awful game itself with some little tweaks like the game modes which aren't really all that special. I wish i could take a team, recruit a certain type of player and play beautiful football but doing that you can see results like Man City losing at home against Luton, Man City haven't lost at home for a year or so. Biggest thing for me is CM position being NULL now, instead having to have two DM's and a bunch of CM's retrained there just to get something working. They say something new and big will come for 25, but the lack of anything this year how could I want to purchase? DO BETTER SI. DO BETTER MILES. YOUR GAME IS AWFUL.",Negative

The players complain all the time for various reasons and you can placate them once, for them to complain again. Everyone wants to play all the time, even if they play poorly. Training results don't matter at all, as the ones that are marked as Important players and train poorly still expect to play and if you bench them, they complain that they are unhappy.

Doesn't matter whether it would or would not happen irl, IT'S NOT FUN!

Football Manager 2024,2252570,have to uninstall every time it updates. very frustrating and needs fixing and all my other games work and update perfectly fine and the other football manager games ive had previously ive never had this problem. Very disappointing.,Negative

Football Manager 2024,2252570,"I get that the game needs to be hard and all, but making it so that my centre backs stand still so that the opposition players can score, it a bit much.Making it so that AI team's players who can barely pass a ball can score from 30m out is too much.Started off good, here we are at the usual place, permanent FM'ing.This being said, watch me get 1000h on this one.",Negative
Football Manager 2024,2252570,"Crashes in the match engine constantly, never had this with a FM game before. Specs are 7900x3d, RTX 4090, 32GB ram, and a standard M2 drive. I can barely play a game with out the engineer starting to chug, and eventually crash my system",Negative
Football Manager 2024,2252570,"i have come to the conclusion that FM 24 is a unbalanced game, the problem starts from the match engine. AI will always have one shot one goal and a common theme seems to be how many chances i create and miss with elite players especially given how much higher my average XG is compared to the opponents and it's a recurring issue that happens over and over again, what else? players seemed to constantly given away the ball and defenders don't know how to defend. another issue is training players consistently train poorly even player who have high professionalism you have to constantly tell them they don't train well usually it doesn't work.my recommendation is wait to see if they fix the match engine until then its a very frustrating experience",Negative
Football Manager 2024,2252570,"Definitely, in my opinion, so far one of the worst Football Managers. I've spent five seasons as a manager, and every time after the winter break, my team falls apart, and there's no way to prevent it. I string together 6-7 defeats and draws, using the same tactics, the same players, everything the same. It's the same story every time. Also, it would be clear to me if I were playing with a weaker team, but I'm playing with the best team, with which I used to convincingly beat opponents. Additionally, playing in the Champions League has built a significant budget for quality players, so I have better players than the entire league, yet this always happens after the winter break.",Negative
Football Manager 2024,2252570,"the game is extremely slow, lots of unnecessary screen that slow the play down.I wont be buying another football manager again.",Negative
Football Manager 2024,2252570,it's a same scripted game with slightly adjusted graphics but same math behind which didn't change in last 5 years. buy only if its your first ever FM.,Negative
Football Manager 2024,2252570,The level of unrealism in this version of the game is phenomenal.,Negative
Football Manager 2024,2252570,"Yeah no i dont know why but this game really isnt it, it seems more impossible than fm23 for some reasonnot enjoyable at all, even with friends",Negative
Football Manager 2024,2252570,"Just another repackaged edition, I'm not sure if FM run out of idea's, if maybe the tech isn't available yet to improve to the game  or what but I see no improvements. The very least FM could have sold us an update instead of advertising a new game which this clearly isn't. If you haven't already brought this years edition, I can tell you you're missing nothing from previous editions.",Negative
Football Manager 2024,2252570,"Another year full of issues that somehow aren't picked up in testing??Player interactions are once again random trash. Even if you avoid interacting with them they will STILL randomly become unhappy with you.Fatigue kicks in with minimal training and game time meaning you need to send your players on holiday 3 times a season. This of course also means they aren't developing because you can't train them.Incorrect data.Poor scouting.DoF trying to sign players you can't play due to work permits.They've tried to cover it with some flashy graphics - analysis, cup draws, deadline day etc but it's all style and no substance.",Negative
Football Manager 2024,2252570,"The game keeps crashing and has so many glitches and flaws. It feels like the game has been rushed out without any final checks. Its as though the devs have just been like ""release it anyway as people will buy it!"" Developers, take note and fix it!!",Negative
Football Manager 2024,2252570,it's an annoying game to play. you have to play in a specific way to win. defeats the whole purpose of the game,Negative

Football Manager 2024,2252570,"It looks the same as FM22, save for a few insignificant bells and whistles, but is more frustrating to play because morale and player interactions are completely broken. Don't purchase new versions, just play the old ones -- its probably a better experience.",Negative
Football Manager 2024,2252570,"Recent update has broken my game, i cant even open it up anymore. Nice",Negative

Football Manager 2024,2252570,"what a mess, they're re-releasing the same game every year, only tweaking the a little bit here and there , and every year the game is buggier than the previous year, the only saving grace is you can load your FM 23 save here, but still the match engine and player reaction is completely broken",Negative

Football Manager 2024,2252570,Absolutely unplayable. Always encounter error after end of the 2nd Season. Tried to contact their support team but no reply available. Not worth the money spent with this kind of customer service!!,Negative

Football Manager 2024,2252570,Same old rubbish with different coloured lipstick on. Oh and injuries are an absolute hiss take. Worse than i can ever remember before. Won't be giving SI any more of my money. This just stinks more and more of rip-off every year.,Negative
Football Manager 2024,2252570,It's just not football. I've been playing Championship Manager and Football Manager for god knows how many years and I must say these newer games are crap. It's fantasy football. Twenty shots on goal and still lose 1-0 to a team that's had one shot all game. I hope the move to the Unity engine improves things. SI need competition and the genre needs it badly.,Negative
Football Manager 2024,2252570,Very boring match engine feels like i watch the same game everytime with no variety. Every highlight is the same and its just not fun to play,Negative
Football Manager 2024,2252570,"Bugged, Always conceding from crosses",Negative
Football Manager 2024,2252570,Buggy AF,Negative
Football Manager 2024,2252570,Same game as usual. You need to play how the game is designed and wants you to play to have any chance of success. You cant be your own manager and play with your own tactics.,Negative

Football Manager 2024,2252570,Not enough work has gone into this years version. Seems like SI have got lazy and little to no improvements year on year.Lots of issues raised on the forums but no real progress made.,Negative

Football Manager 2024,2252570,A joke of a game. Absolutely rubbish AI.,Negative
Football Manager 2024,2252570,Same like previous games. Moronic developers of this game should know that if there is 1 unhappy player that doesn't mean that i should lose 3 games in a row even though in each i had 30-1 ratio of shots but was hitting posts while opponent scored from 1 chance. That never happens in real life.,Negative
Football Manager 2024,2252570,"denuvo is stopping me from playing a game i rightfully bought, i had to uninstall the game in the hope that if i reinstall it again it will work but it still kept showing the same thing. im soo annoyed",Negative

Football Manager 2024,2252570,Board still selling players willy nilly. Realistic maybe but at least let me send an ultimatum more than once every few months.,Negative
Football Manager 2024,2252570,Game feels unfinished. Too many bugs and some of the headline features don't exist.,Negative
Football Manager 2024,2252570,"Football Manager 24 maintains its managerial excellence, with a notable upgrade in match graphics. However, the lack of major game play changes disappoints, making it feel more like an incremental update than a significant advancement. While the enhanced visuals are a welcome touch, the absence of groundbreaking features leaves enthusiasts yearning for more innovation. Here's hoping future iterations inject fresh excitement into the franchise.",Negative
Football Manager 2024,2252570,"Initially it's another SI bug fest that I still enjoy a lot. Match engine is better to watch, players are indeed quite fluid with movements but also has way more visual bugs like keepers making saves without actually touching the ball or the ball just zig zagging around the place a lot without any players near it. Player decision making is still really poor going forward however. Will update after more game time.",Negative
Football Manager 2024,2252570,"whilst UI is greatly improved.  Same faults that have existed for numerous incarnations still exist.  They are already well documented.  Save your money until the new game engine is implemented in next years game,",Negative
Football Manager 2024,2252570,Unplayable at the moment. Wait for a patch.. Conversations with players inevitably turn into a full squad meltdown.,Negative
Football Manager 2024,2252570,FIX YOUR BUGS!!!,Negative
Football Manager 2024,2252570,"As usual, rubbish on release.",Negative
Football Manager 2024,2252570,I have never posted an online review for the previous versions of FM that I have bought. But I am posting for this one. Because I am so annoyed with the broken player interaction in this game. One player goes down a league to join 'a bigger club'. Other players with a 2 and a half star rating start demanding high wages as soon as you get promoted that dont merit their ability. Then the whole squad is unhappy with your treatment of that player because they too want a high contract. And this is all when they know that the club is 40 million in debt.,Negative
Football Manager 2024,2252570,Fix the Serbian league registration rules ffs,Negative
Football Manager 2024,2252570,Same game every year. If anything it's even more BS than previous versions,Negative
Football Manager 2024,2252570,"For me as a fan of the series and played everyone I just dont think the changes since the previous game are note worthy or impacting to enthuse me to play more.  Things like the match engine, fans and overall visuals of the game very poor for a modern game.  I know that this is the last version as we know it, but its long overdue and feel this game is merely just an update in players and little more.",Negative
Football Manager 2024,2252570,"It's as fun as always, but there are some gamebreaking bugs, in particular the wages sheet is broken. Players I have in my team are appearing twice on the list, while the players I've signed to start the next season aren't taken into account at all - their wages count into ""committed spending"" while they are considering the contract and then disappear once they agree - that's FTX level of creative accounting.Selection advice in the team selection sometimes suggests a change, but then doesn't actually perform it when I click ""use suggested squad"". Quick pick picks different players than selection advice, even though the same coach is to pick the team and there are no settings conflicting.",Negative
Football Manager 2024,2252570,"The amount of obviously scripted moments in this game is at an all time hige, you can call goals 1-2 minutes before they happen in the game. patterns are so easy to see it is insane.Game is still good and would recomend it as it is a solid game but man the scripting is bad at times",Negative
Football Manager 2024,2252570,Too many bugs,Negative
Football Manager 2024,2252570,"where to start.ME is only good when you are attacking, gk and defenders dont engage or move, your players decide to randomly give the ball to opposition either by running into them or blind passes and set pieces are being broken",Negative
Football Manager 2024,2252570,still cant play fm 24 after numerous attempts..does any one have issues,Negative
Football Manager 2024,2252570,Not much has changed if anything its worse. My players are all injured every day. selling is still a pain and the player usually doesnt want to leave. i can beat man city 3-0 but then lose to teams like Luton with the exact same players?,Negative
Football Manager 2024,2252570,"Game is about 5 patches away from being decent, just wait for a sale not worth.",Negative
Football Manager 2024,2252570,They lied.Japanese leagues aren't available.. This is low even by SI and SEGA standards.,Negative
Football Manager 2024,2252570,"Another year of false advertising. Where is bestter lighting during game, better AI squad building, licenced J league, AI transfer improvements. But numbers are good for SI, so they will keep doing what they have been doing in the past few years",Negative
Football Manager 2024,2252570,"Not worth for now. Every single edition we need to wait for patches to patch some obvious stuff, like competition rules and some bugs that are carried over version by version.But now, for FM24, the deliver has a lot of problems, like the players tutoring, overload of gols from throw-ins, excessive complaints by the squad about lack of depth. And not to mention the J-League licensing issue with some players missing.This is not how we deliver a full game after the paid beta access where they had some feedback about those issues.Now to play it we need to wait one month for the first patch? And will it fix all the stuff? I don't know...",Negative
Football Manager 2024,2252570,"Features that were working fine in previous versions are even broken, which is unforgivable in my opinion.For example every single transfer you delegate to your director of football fails as the player ""has rejected our contract as we cannot meet his wage demands"".The game is a broken mess in it's current state.",Negative

Counter-Strike 2,730,teammates racist,Negative
Counter-Strike 2,730,"Counter Strike 2 claims to be a cutting-edge gaming experience, but beneath its flashy graphics and intense gameplay lies a cesspool of frustration and disappointment. The primary issue plaguing this supposed gaming masterpiece is the rampant cheating problem that has infested the community like a virus, rendering the entire gaming experience virtually unplayable.The introduction of the so-called ""state-of-the-art"" anti-cheat system is nothing short of a disaster. Instead of effectively targeting and eliminating cheaters, it seems to indiscriminately punish innocent players who happen to have high DPI settings. This heavy-handed approach has created an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty, where players are constantly on edge, wondering if they'll be wrongfully banned for simply optimising their gaming setup for better performance.The anti-cheat system's obsession with high DPI settings is not only misguided but also a blatant disregard for the diverse gaming community. Many players invest time and money into acquiring quality gaming peripherals, only to find themselves penalised by Counter Strike 2's flawed system. It's disheartening to see a game prioritise false positives over legitimate players who genuinely contribute to the gaming community.Adding insult to injury is the developer's lackluster response to the growing complaints. The forums are filled with frustrated players sharing their experiences of unfair bans, only to be met with generic responses and a lack of transparency. It's evident that the developers are more concerned with marketing their faulty anti-cheat system than addressing the legitimate concerns of their player base.The prevalence of cheaters in Counter Strike 2 further exacerbates the issue. It's not uncommon to encounter blatant hackers who ruin the experience for everyone. From aimbots to wallhacks, the game's servers are infested with players who exploit vulnerabilities, making a mockery of fair competition.In conclusion, Counter Strike 2's promise of an immersive gaming experience is overshadowed by its incompetence in handling the cheating epidemic. The heavy-handed approach of the anti-cheat system, particularly its misguided focus on high DPI settings, has turned the game into a frustrating ordeal for innocent players. Until the developers address these fundamental issues and prioritise the well-being of their player base, Counter Strike 2 remains a disappointing and unplayable mess. Save your time and money for a game that values its community and delivers on its promises.First we had people being banned for just merely using Windows 7 as an operating system, then we had people being banned for having an AMD related graphics card and now we have people being wrongfully banned for having high DPI and fooling around by spinning at the start of rounds.",Negative

Grand Theft Auto V,271590,"Great game story line is almost perfect and fun. Completed in about 66hr, or less i did a lot of random stuff like online not just the missions back to back. Honestly you could probably knock this game out in 2 or 3 weekends if you wanted to. I don't have any extra stuff just the game the over all game play was great the bots weren't to hard to kill. Police were fairly balanced if you wanted to fight them you could but it was just as easy to hide. But my main complaint would be the ending of the story mode i feel like they could have made it more harder to kill the leaders or at least made killing them each having a separate mission. They Likely could have gotten an extra 20 minutes or so out of it I just feel like with the base game theirs some thing that should have been added. It just feels like you were riled up for a bit finish with 3 big fights and it didn't happen. But I would still play and don't regret buying.",Positive

These are things that require 3 million, 6 million.... It takes weeks if not months for a new player to get this amount of money.- Online takes 6 minutes to load, on an SSD.- Floating uncontrollable van on the Motorcycle Club resupply mission.- Ammo disappearing in online which requires you to re-buy which is incredibly expensive.- Rapid fire bug that makes NPCs insta-kill a player out of nowhere.

EA SPORTS FC 24,2195250,"This is an complete and utter joke. Even when I first purchased the game is took about 3-4 start up attempts until it actually stayed open and didn't just close after reaching the main menu. Now however the game is literally unplayable. Instantly closes upon main menu. Every. Single. Time. I have spent the better part of 2 days wasting my time trying to look for a fix but there isn't one. I have reinstalled the game several times, reinstalled windows and everything else that could possibly be done. I have had some poor experiences with games not working before this one takes the cake. There is no reason at all for this to happen other than EA being a terrible company that doesn't address and fix these issues. My PC far surpasses all the recommended requirements with ease. The most annoying thing is when the game was working I was actually really enjoying it so my disappointment is now two-fold. Never been a fan of EA as an organisation however I think I now have genuine hatred for them. To charge the amount they charge for a game that literally doesn't even work for thousands of people and do nothing about it is absolutely disgusting.

Players have expressed widespread dissatisfaction with the overall gaming experience, citing issues ranging from clunky controls to lackluster mechanics. The game's attempt at a revamped visual presentation seems to have fallen short of redeeming its flaws, ultimately contributing to an overall sense of disappointment among the gaming community.

EA SPORTS FC 24,2195250,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 69 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 1901 from his ""uncle"", so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 420 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching Tiktok. So i decided to make a Tiktok account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. It was all going so well until... I heard a loud thump upstairs. As I walked up the stairs, I saw pieces of what seemed to be a controller shattered across the floor. As I peeked behind the door, I looked at my Son and realised that he had killed himself playing this game. Now I have nothing. This game has destroyed what little part of my life still brought joy.",Negative

Cities: Skylines II,949230,"For some reason I could never get into the first game, so I don't have a great way to compare. But after getting the hang of some of the mechanics of this game, wow. It's a lot of fun. It's rewarding to see your city grow and the attention to detail is really nice. It feels like a living world.

Cities: Skylines II,949230,"Lots of computer performance questions - particularly important as your city grows larger. However, if you have the horsepower, this is a truly remarkable game. There are many improvements over the first major version, which lasted nearly 10 years and had tons of DLC love, so a large community exists already. I'm most impressed by the simulation algorithm, which has moved forward in significant ways. People have their entire lives charted and take actions that are commensurate - going to work, going shopping, going to schools in the area, etc. There are certainly many little bugs and behavioral patterns to work out, but I'm confident the Colossal Order team is committed to perfecting this beast. It's enormously fun, and a big step forward in city sim builders.",Positive

Cities: Skylines II,949230,"Do I recommend this game? Yes, but...Honestly, I want to love this game, but there are so many little things that annoy me I just can't. I am addicted to it and hate it all at the same time.My biggest frustration is it is absolutely brutal when it comes to being a perfectionist. If I want a 90 degree angle I want a 90 degree angle. Not 90.01 so that as I get further in my city development of city streets the entire grid system goes to hell. It has literally ruined every city that I have tried to build.My other frustration is that there is no undo button. If you are using the landscaping tool and botch it...that's it no way to fix it...just live with it.Yes there are a lot of really good qualities to this game, it is absolutely beautiful and its awesome watching your town turn into a city. The freedom to build is only hindered by its minor consistency issues, but those minor issues have become a big deal to me in the long run. I really hope that they end up adjusting little things like this in the future.",Positive

Cities: Skylines II,949230,"As an avid fan of all city builders, and huge fan of cities skyline 1, I have really loved playing CS2. The game launched with a rocky start but the dev team has been on top of it with frequent patches and fielding feedback from the community. I enjoy the mechanics of this game compared to it's predecessor and look forward to seeing the game improve some more as modding is released, and the dev team addresses more of the minor bugs.People here complain about it being a half-finished game, but I would disagree. Could it have been pushed back a few weeks to deliver a more polished experience? Sure, but if it were my choice, I would've wanted them to release it anyways so I could start playing as soon as possible.",Positive

Cities: Skylines II,949230,You are going to need a beast of machine to play this game.

My RTX 3060 struggles to run this game and most of my settings are low or off so that my computer does not overheat.  Optimization aside the game is fun city builder and I am going to upgrade my rig soon so that i can enjoy this game in its full glory.,Positive

Per now it also looks like content that should have been released with the game, are postponed to early next year. Since modding is missing, I also find that there is a severe lack in content. Most games released in this state use the label ""early acesss"".In the future this could become a good city builder. As of now I cannot recommend buying it.",Negative
Cities: Skylines II,949230,"Honestly I want to love this game, after falling in love with CS1 a few years ago I jumped the gun and pre-bought this. I have played on and off for a few months now. Whilst the game has some major improvements over the first it is just unplayable in it's current state. Starting with the basics the tutorial  is bare bones and considering how much new content there is there should be a more in depth tutorial. For instance i had a city of around 30,000 with no high residential demand, after watching youtube I realised that I can tax each type of residential differently. Also the game really hates the player placing larger buildings, i have had my pc crash a few times placing the international airport and lag like hell when using other large buildings. The traffic system is messed up as hell. Economy is not fully balanced and can be difficult for new players to understand or even generate money, however this game is much more forgiving with the amount of cash you start with and get per milestone.Ps. for new players if you wanna unlock many development points to begin, place water pumps until lv4 then place the park that costs 5,000 which gives 100xp its tedious and long but you can get to grand metropolis without having a single citizen then plan out the perfect city.",Negative

Want any other building style besides ""European"" or ""North American""? Too bad. Fishing industry? nope. Detailed infrastructure? Nope, everything is done for you magically through the ""industry zoning"". Also if you make every road pedestrian only, people love it. Despite having to walk hours to get anywhere.

The recent update... let me tell you... its neat... Every 5 mins the game is crashing.  Not like a freeze then crash... like literally drawing a road and game crashes.  I have built the same road and the same area 10 times this morning.   In 12 to 24 months.... maybe i could recommend this game... as it stand right now its rough... and thats being nice.  With the say things are going i would say stick with cities skylines 1 for the next 2 years then come back and take a look at this game.  They don't have mod support, map designer, glitches, crashes, performance issues, graphics issues... save the money continue with skylines 1 for the next 24 months.Absolute trash right now... uninstalled after the latest patch they just pushed - it broke the game completely for me.   will check back in 12 months to see where they are and if they made the game better.

I feel like now I have to save every 10 minuets to ensure I do not lose any progress. Wish I did that earlier because I now have to rebuild my entire city expansion from housing, resources, even to highway infrastructure.

You cannot control lanes so even if most traffic is turning right you will have a bunch of lanes for going straight or whatever. Car will randomly just stop in the middle of the road and won't move, you have to delete the road to get rid of them. Chirper is useless, they complain and praise anything and everything but you can't turn the stupid thing off. The education system doesn't make any real world sense whatsoever. You have to put down like 10 elementary schools because they keep filling up but hardly anyone is going to highshcool for some reason.

I really loved skylines 1, there is no reason to play skylines 2, it's a mess.Wait another year then come late 2024 and see if they completed the game, it's not worth your money as it is now.",Negative

Cities: Skylines II,949230,"Bought at launch, was holding off on putting a review until the devs had enough patches and time to work on things, but it's clear nothing will change so here we go.Blatant false advertisement, half of the features advertised aren't even in it, basic core gameplay elements aren't even stable, you've had the first game for what 7 years and this is somehow difficult to make? I've put hundreds of hours into the first one but I'm probably not even going to bother with extending the 25.7 hours on this. Features are watered down, slowed down, made too complex, and are half-way implemented, performance is so laggy even on ssd with low settings, It's fun for the first 20 hours but the cracks start showing really bad and it's just not fun to play. The devs have admitted in a post that this current state of the game meets their goals. So I'm done.Have fun to those who still play and will pay for the 15 DLCs that will come out.",Negative

Tom Clancy's The Division 2,2221490,"Gameplay is great, just like the first. Setting not as cool as the original, I liked how the original emphasised the whole virus outbreak thing. It is there in this one, but is just not as emphasised, so the post apocalyptic setting could be caused by anything.The story is kind of lame and boring. Very unimaginative, no emotional  investment in the characters. The enemies are banal. There is no serious thematic explanation as to why they are the bad guys. I suppose you could try to get invested with the audio lore etc, but I felt the original did this better with the post virus apocalypse.",Positive

Tom Clancy's The Division 2,2221490,"This game was pretty great, and then me and my friend got to end game. The free specializations you can immediately unlock are fun, but the system to unlock the next ones is absolutely atrocious. I am currently attempting to get ""Firewall"" and the ""kill enemy or named enemy with while they are afflicted with X status ailments"" got old pretty fast. It is always fun to play ring around the roses with a named enemy that will do any thing and everything to avoid anything that involves the very concept of a status ailment. It is also wonderful when you have a status ailment on your weapon, the enemy is suffering from said status ailment,you kill them, and it doesn't count for some reason beyond your understanding. But don't fret, if you don't want to deal with this absolute not garbage tier system, you can always buy the 1 year pass and get ""Firewall"" without all the hassle. How lovely, I just love it when companies decide to pad their game with terrible systems and then offer a ""way out"" by presenting your wallet to the screen to the vacuum everything out of it.This kind of thing should be expected though, it is Ubisoft after all.",Negative

Vampire Survivors,1794680,"For the price its definitely worth it. But i'm uncertain why this game is so highly rated yes its fun for a few hours but than after you figure out how to actually kill vampires efficiently it officially gets so boring its mind numbing. Gameplay loop is more basic than any other game you will ever find. Quests seem irrelevant run and grab quests that from as far as I understand do almost nothing. But keep in mind this is like a walking simulator because you don't actually control the attacks other than what direction they will travel.But I keep seeing comments saying this game is highly addictive and i just can't get behind that. I think Path of Exiles offers more entertainment in spades.I will still say yes for other people to buy this game though because its price is so low. But keep in mind its hard for me to imagine someone enjoying this game for more than 10 hours, I'm sure you can but I feel like the gameplay doesnt offer anything exciting once you figure out all the item combos.",Positive

I found other games like Brotato and Enter the Gungeon with much more engaging game play. I do not find this game addictive as is mentioned in many other reviews.

Vampire Survivors,1794680,"Compared to other Bullet Hell games I found this to be slow, ugly and imprecise.",Negative
Vampire Survivors,1794680,"This game is a disappointment when it comes to other Bullet Hell games. For starters there is no key bind for manual or auto attack, left and right mouse button does the same thing, and there is no option to individually move and attack. Who's idea was it to have attack and movement combined? Your mouse is literally useless in this game, it does not matter where you aim it because the direction your character is facing determines the direction of the attack.Why would I want to attack and move at the same time? What if I want to move right but attack up? Can't do that, can only move up and attack up, move right and attack right.For a game released in 2022, it feels like it was released 10 years ago with the junky controls. Id rather play any other bullet hell game such as Halls of Torment.Maybe you can get this game on sale, but I would still not play this and play other Bullet Hell genre games.",Negative
Vampire Survivors,1794680,"This game is not too bad, but so boring and too tricky to control. You could walk only 8 directions with W A S D. Using mouse to control your character is laggy because walking limited 8 directions. The game took too long to level up. The map is very simple and monsters are not well animated. The game is very monotone, without any action, you just walk, walk walk and slowly shoot mobs, trying to collect EXP to lvl up.Too boring and over simplified game.",Negative

I bought Army of Ruin and found it also is AUTOMATIC ATTACKS And added a new TAG.These type games should be RUNNING BACK SIMULATOR.In God of Weapons it statesIn this action roguelike, survive hordes of monsters on every level with automatic weapon attacks.

Vampire Survivors,1794680,"I personally don't enjoy the gameplay, especially the kiting, even early, it's just not fun for me.

Vampire Survivors,1794680,"I think I might be one of two people who doesn't actually enjoy the game. It's good, really! If you want a simple zone out game it's probably the best there is. I wanted something more akin to Smash TV or Crimsonland. Did I expect the wrong thing? Yes. Did I get bored after a level ran for 15 minutes on my fifth playthrough? Extremely. It's a well made, well supported game and I hated it.If you're a normal person this is great, if you're the kind of lunatic to beat Insanity mode on the original Mass Effect, move on.",Negative

If you really want to play a good game of this, you have to sink in like a whole day, and it's just not worth it. It's kind of a terrible trap, really. Don't start it and you won't be stuck trying to finish it.",Negative
Sid Meier's Civilization V,8930,Do not play this game! It's far too visually and mentally stimulating. It's totally addictive. You can play as  numerous historical leaders and a multitude of different sized worlds against a different variety of other leaders every game. AND it's not too nerdy! I've played nearly 5000 hours now! You have been warned!,Negative
Sid Meier's Civilization V,8930,"not sure why the game has such a positive rating, maybe it just isnt my stylethe gameplay seems repetitive as you only shoot enemies and mine resourcesthe 3D map is a struggle to use and the dark environment makes it hard to navigateyou are also constantly threatened by rough terrain, fall damage, and the lack of ammooverall, i wouldnt recommend this game, unless you enjoy challenging and grindy games",Negative
Sid Meier's Civilization V,8930,"Product received for freeJust not that dynamic of a playing experience.  Lacks the feel and magic of previous Civ editions.   I like Civ 2 for the interesting storylines and random history.  Civ 3 for sheer gameplay, Civ 4 for the enhanced graphics and mechanics, and Civ 6 is much better than Civ 5 IMO",Negative

Played it for years. But now, I can't. It sucks. Better than Civ 6 though, which doesn't run at all.",Negative
Sid Meier's Civilization V,8930,"Always loved the civ series but V killed it for me. Gone are overlapping systems you could dynamically respond to and manipulate as the game goes on. Instead you pick one way to win at the beginning of the game and just dogmatically follow it until the end. The Civs are too different from one another and too locked into certain strategies.Also, I don't care about the tactical battles. I want to be running a civilization, my generals should handle the nitty gritty of combat.",Negative

Sid Meier's Civilization V,8930,"I've played Civs 4-6 and Civ5 is the best one of them, so my negative review applies even more to other games in the series.Civ5 lacks meaningful interaction. Almost all decisions are internal.Most decisions are obvious, yet you still have to make them. Yes, this one caravan still will go the same route that makes me most money.Most decisions DON'T MATTER. Game lacks heavy, meaningful choices past early game.Late game is really boring.Nations are asymmetrical, but differences between them don't translate in differences in gameplay. Almost every nation plays the same.Combat is almost always meaningless. Most of the time you are not required to have any military units available to you and building them wastes a lot of time. Which means, the best move is always to befriend your neighbors and focus on internal affairs and economy. That reduces any player interaction to almost zero, because politics is shallow, superficial and pointless.",Negative

Portal 2,620,"I jumped into the game blind, i only knew that this game has portals in it, that's all and i ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT. The game has a lot of clever puzzles and fun gameplay, AMAZING story along with the soundtrack that is perfect in every situation that you're in. Even if you complete the main story it's still fun to replay thanks to the amazing portal mechanic and the fact that it's easy to forget solutions to some puzzles. If you get bored of that there is still a Multiplayer mode where you can complete new puzzles with your friend or a stranger. And on top of that once you get the hang of the game's mechanics you can complete other player's puzzles OR even try to create your own puzzle! The game is just amazing and i think everyone with a PC should play it",Positive

Portal 2,620,"Absolutely horrible and unbearably stressful. You just do these ""puzzles"" or ""tests"" or whatever, but it's literally just perfect timing, murder robots, and hoping you don't breathe the wrong way and mess up everything. There's enough anxiety in life, don't pay ten dollars for more.",Negative
Portal 2,620,"From puzzles, I want satisfying complex logic. A lot of this game is more about figuring out which map details are points of interest at all. It's not about the logic, it's about learning the environment for each new puzzle.Other aspects of the game are good, but this is enough for me to not want to play the last third of the game.",Negative
Portal 2,620,"At some point, the game becomes veeeeeeeeeeery boring and annoying. Do more tests so that you can do more tests then climb then climb then climb then do more tests and then some more. Yeah, yeah. The first game was simpler, but it had its charm. In contrast, Portal 2 was made to be more complex, but along with that it lost this charm.Of course, Portal 2 has some pros. It has some fun parts, defective turrets, Cave Johnson, airhead but hilarious Wheatley. References to the first part of Portal are nostalgic, scenery in some parts is honestly breathtaking. But for me, the most important thing was that the game is tooooooo long so it basically becomes really boring. I just wished for it to end faster, so that I complete it and am done with it.",Negative

Portal 2,620,"Does Portal 2 improve upon its predecessor? The answer is yes, but at the same time, improvements seem marginal to me, save for the multiplayer aspect, which was possibly the most meaningful addition, and the most fun I had in the game.Portal's 2 story, save for some moments during Cave Johnson's appearance and the upbringings of Aperture Science reveal, is as mundane than its predecessor's, with the writing resembling a Disney movie really. The ending is ridiculous, but in a bad way.Puzzles are the same level of difficulty as Portal 1, afraid to challenge the player in any way. Even though an easy puzzle can still be a good puzzle given the context, what was missing here was exactly that context, so I felt I was flying from one easy puzzle to the next, without exploring the possible puzzle space given the mechanics, or pondering more thoroughly about an interesting interaction.Traversal is improved, I actually liked the walking simulator-like parts and enjoyed exploring Aperture Science in its entirety.Overall, Portal 2 does not hold up today as people claim it does. There are much better games today, story-wise, gameplay-wise, design-wise, in regards to puzzles, mechanics-wise, and what they can make you feel and experience.",Negative

Love the story, the combat, and the side mission.The side mission might need to be improved somehow, cause I don't feel the connection when I did the mission, where the character is just so plain and boring.Now for the cons. I only have 1 really bad thing I have to say about this game. which is the controller. I noticed that my controller connection is like gone after a while playing this game. which is totally random.Had to refer to forum on how to fix this. hope the developer fix it soon.That's all.",Positive

Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales,1817190,Loved the first spiderman remastered so naturally I picked up Mile's Spiderman. It was good and there were some nice improvements like the fighting was sped up and swinging around was a bit better. The only problem was I found it short. I finished the whole game in 19 hours.  Wish it had been a bit longer with some more action but it wasn't a bad game. I'm thinking this could have been a part of the DLC from the original Spiderman.  The important part is it was fun and looked great.,Positive

Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales,1817190,I don't recommend it because of the price. It's a very short game. I also don't recommend it because it's very repetitive to the point where the game itself is just about collecting items. It also has crashing issues that I didn't encounter until the very last mission which sucks.,Negative
Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales,1817190,every time i restart a mission it closes the game completely have uninstalled and installed multiple times and still the same issue so now when i start my game i get into the loading screen and it closes cant even play the game,Negative

Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales,1817190,"It's too short to be a full game release in my honest opinion. This should have been a DLC to Spider-man 1. It's a very cool game otherwize, but not worth the money.",Negative
Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales,1817190,"This game bugs out so much it's unreal. I have a computer more than capable of running it , but I always end up with lag , misinputs or simply just the game crashing on itself and then refusing to boot back up.The story-line itself as well is super basic and very predictable. You'll be able to figure out the 'plot twists' very quickly.  Not worth buying or playing to be honest.",Negative

Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales,1817190,"A great game but yet another horribly optimized PC port. This game is insanely unoptimized and unstable, with an amount of crashes to desktop that make playing it a lesson in frustration.

Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales,1817190,"Great game so far, but it does crash quite a bit. I can't do any stolen car chases because the moment he jumps on the car the game just freezes and all I can do is quit and re-enter the game, I'm just starting and there is a part where there is a cut scene and he just finishes this big event at the bridge and then my game just froze again. I want to recommend the game but I have a hard time with how often its crashing and I'm just starting out. Hopefully they get this worked out more because the game is fun and the story is cool so far.",Negative
Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales,1817190,"Trash port just like Remastered. Not just like Remastered, actually, because I beat the entire game and the DLC with maybe 7 crashes. Miles crashes not only all the time but more than Remastered. I could not even play 1 hour of this game before it crashed 3 times. I've verified game cache and completely reinstalled it twice but it's literally unplayable.I9-13900k, RTX4090 on 546.17, 64 GB DDR5-6600, no other games have this issue. Would be great to actually play the game.",Negative
Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales,1817190,I have to play two times Normal and New Game Plus because it was to short. The City is ugly and there is not to match to do. Story is OK but there are no bosses. First 15 minutes of the game is most interesting. The combat is boring.,Negative

He all of a sudden launches a web to the left and I lose all momentum and smash into a wall. Completely ruins my ability to navigate and have fun in the game.",Negative
Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales,1817190,Really fun game. The combat mechanics and movement are super satisfying. The main problem is that it crashes pretty frequently. No performance issues up until it spontaneously decides to crash every hour or so. Sometimes it'll crash at launch. I am currently unable to finish the game because it keeps crashing. I really wish these PC ports were better.,Negative
Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales,1817190,Not worth buying. Game is fun and great gameplay but since it came out it has a problem with constant crashes. They never fixed it and your not able to properly play it. Big no,Negative
Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales,1817190,Dont buy it! This game is too short,Negative
Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales,1817190,cant get past the loading screan,Negative
Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales,1817190,"I got this game plus Spider-Man remastered.  Loved the first game, but had a few crashes.  Nothing I can't get past.  So once I finished that one I booted up Miles Morales.  I loved most of the changes to the game and the story seems amazing...but I can't go any further.  I'm 5.5 hours into the game and when ever I try to load the game up it crashes.  I'm not about to replay those 5.5 hours.  It's very disappointing because it feels like it got just as much love, if not more than the remastered spider-man.  I was willing to excuse the random crash here and there but the fact that I can't load my game at all anymore is horrible, especially for a game that is 1 year old",Negative
Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales,1817190,"IIt's a good game, but it is weaker than the previous one in practically everything, also the amount of bugs and rough edges in this game is insane, There is not a 15 minutes in this game I would not get some bug or random crash. Buy only heavily discounted.",Negative
Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales,1817190,"Overall the game is good, but its very overpriced considering how little game there actually is here...On top of that, it is incredibly unstable and crashes constantly on reloads, which has apparently been an issue since it launched on PC. I want to recommend it, but considering the terrible stability I honestly can't.",Negative
Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales,1817190,"I didn't like the original game but I wanted to get some winter holidays vibes so I decided to try to switch my brain to ""average PlayStation fan"" mode and enjoy the Miles Morales DLC which I got on sale.Overall, it is a great game about people of colour fighting the white male oppressor. Strong women, lesbians are also in this game. These topics are very important these days, so I am glad they are all in this game.I liked the dialogues, especially the dramatic ones with ""You don't understand - no, you don't understand! I want to save you, you want to save me, I've got to do this and not that because I am Spider-Man!""Other than that, there is nothing to add, it is similar to the original. an average mediocre PlayStation exclusive.",Negative
Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales,1817190,"This is my first review of a game because it left me with such a feeling that I thought it was warranted.I liked that this game was short - it was a good follow-up to the first game. The combat was fun but repetitive.But man, in my opinion, the characters in this game are a giant snooze-fest. Ganke is just boring, but my biggest issue is with Phin.The fact that Phin consistently kicks your ass the entire game is so laughable and so frustrating. There is nothing that the game does to build up any sort of rapport or backstory with her to make me feel like I should care about her. It's literally one dinner scene and then all of a sudden she's the villain. The writers felt like it would make for a really enjoyable experience for you to lose each encounter with her. You're telling me that just because she has this fancy gear, that makes her a more competent fighter? Give me a break. And then she sacrifices herself at the end? I don't actually get to defeat her? The story would have been great without her in it. It ruined the experience.",Negative
Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales,1817190,Not worth 49.99. I beat the main story in just over 9 hours. If this were cheaper than I would be much happier,Negative
Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales,1817190,"Fun game when you can actually play it. Whenever you die, fast travel, or even load into the game it crashes. Would only recommend if you have a PS5 that won't give you any crashes problems",Negative

Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales,1817190,The best way to describe the spiderman experience would be something like this. Basically you are                                       going to restart the game every 20 minutes or every time you take a fast attemptat a challen                  ge mastery.game is great but annoying to restart so often. the software for Sony has stopped asking for crash reports at this point. basically not a fully functional game. If i didn't buy it on super sale i would be extremely mad. Not a AAA title.Not worth full price.,Negative
Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales,1817190,"It's fantastic and if you can get it for cheap then get it, but do not buy this for 50 dollars. the entire story can be beaten in 10 hours and the side content isn't worth it. It's the most fun you'll have while being utterly disappointed in what you purchased.",Negative
Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales,1817190,"un juego corto, y la historia no me parecio tan interesante y buena como el primero. sentia que la ciudad y las misiones secundarias solo estan a un lado sin mayor importancia, en el primero al menos daban ganas de hacer las misiones y ganas de recorrer la ciudad. en este la verdad solo avanzaba en la historia principal sin mas",Negative
Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales,1817190,"Save files corrupting all the time, every time i die i'm out the game, i fix it by deleting the main corrupted one and renaming the backup that worked for a bit but now even the backup becomes corrupted so i have to use the other backup and even when that works i have to play through another 20 minute section of the game to get back to where i was, not to mention that every time i load up again i have to wait through all the credits like sony, marvel etc. Cmon guys this is BS",Negative

Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales,1817190,graphics and optimization is always top notch with insomniac..Buuuut this game compared to original spider man is way too short for the price also  compared to the first game i can't call any of the fights in this game a boss fight.This game should have been a dlc to the first game and the dlcs in the first game should have been added as a side quest instead.There is no humour in this game first game even though it heavily used family friendly language and i don't recall that game being this bad in humour and story wise.pass this one just play the first you won't miss anything in my honest opinion,Negative
Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales,1817190,"Looks amazing and plays extremely well. However,m I cannot recommend this game unless you plan to spend the entirety of the game playing it in one go as there is no save functionality.

Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales,1817190,"This game boasts stunning graphics and incredible mechanics that truly capture the essence of a beloved superhero. The web-swinging action is a marvel to behold, and the visuals are a treat for the eyes. When it's up and running, it's a thrill to play.However, a frustrating issue puts a serious dent in an otherwise fantastic experience - frequent crashes. These technical problems interrupt the game's flow and make it difficult to fully enjoy the superb mechanics and graphics. It's tough to stay immersed in the game when you're constantly worried about progress being lost due to these disruptions. Sadly, I had to request a refund.",Negative
Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales,1817190,"I don't know why but after playing Red Dead Redemption 2, the open world of this game feels boring, everyone feels like a soulless robot and on top of that, this game ain't worth my money because it's too short",Negative

VRChat,438100,"Early Access ReviewHow the times have changed... How to tables have turned... VR chat isn't what it used to be anymore, and it all have to do with choices that feels so much like mistakes, and the anti-consumercy is real.VRChat used to be something beautiful, a perfect place to socialize and interact with people. Although there were bad apples in there, who always causes pain, and drama, I always seem to find the good and continuing in meeting new people. However, that has changed.VRchat is basically a sellout. They're marketing strategy has shifted to a more pay to use type of thing. And now, with the recent updates that have been released which nobody knows that their privacy is basically being invaded by something they didn't know that they gave consent towards.You probably remember agreeing to some terms and services before being giving permission to enter inside VRChat. All I'm going to say is, those who played Black Cat Cafe or whatever it is named, everything that was once free, is no more. There is a paywall to gain access to the things that were free since the beginning of time. And to gain access to the things that are locked you have to pay more money, and if you are to ever go to check out this VRChat plus, you shall see a new logo called ""V"", which I believe is stands for Virtual Currency.That's right, VRChat has just became a whole new thing full of pay walls, to gain access to things that were once free. Asking ridiculous amounts, even after they basically have given us nothing. The game constantly still crashes, so nothing new there. Ever since the day allowed Anti Cheat to become a thing, it has done nothing but ruin everything that made VRchat amazing and usable. Even though I understand the reason why, as long as it exists, VRChat will continue to crash.The very essence of what made VRchat great, is gone, it's slowly vanishing. And you have the developers to blame, because they obviously don't care about us. They don't care about what we want, they don't care about what we need, they don't care about anything so long as they can profit from it. At this point the only comparison I can compare this to is a application that used to be known or wide during those whom attended high school years.Those who are familiar with an app called ""Amino"", know exactly where I'm going with this. Used to be free, easy access, nothing to worry about, but BOOM! Your hit with many things, in-app currency, to make yourself look cool, just like how ""Discord"" was once free, but Saw the popularity grow to where it led them to profit from whatever it is they can. Although this doesn't clearly count as nowhere near as worse as Amino, and the route VRChat devs are going in towards.It just feels like one of those things where it's all about getting money now, it's time to profit, it doesn't matter how old the game is, so long as they add new things to make it seem like it's worth every penny spent. That's all that matters to them.If I'm being honest, it's completely pointless. The VRChat already has VRChat Plus. What more can they add? To what more they could need?In fair honesty, it's terrible choices. And this is the norm of how groups of developers do things. Even companies make horrible choices, but even then they can make amends and make things right to actually make a difference.Of course these are my own thoughts and feelings on the choices that they are making.VRChat is still unusable, it lags, it force kicks people out, and it's only getting worser with every update that doesn't actually fix anything or stabilizes things. VRChat feels more of a cash grab now, and it feels more like a mobile port than anything else.One thing I will make clear is, it doesn't hurt to support content creators. But, if a world that's already been out for a long time, only to then be swapped edited, with newer paywalls to gain access the things that were once free is absurd. Shame on you. Shame on the choices you've made. Do better. Because it feels like you really don't care about us, if you are more than willing to violate our privacy, VRChat Devs.Actually do something that will make the people of the VRC community feel safe. That's all I will say, overall I hope you all have an amazing rest of your day. And thank you for reading.",Negative

VRChat,438100,Early Access ReviewDISTASTEFUL. that is how i describe the new update. for starters. WHO IN THE RIGHT MIND THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD IDEA TO ADD TRANSACTIONS. a free game that makes you pay money to support people when its more likely to pocket most of it and give only a fraction of the little amount given back. two. THE GOSH DANG CONTENT FILTER. i get it you know. VR chat has way to many kids in the game and they should be protected from the harsh environment. but if you wanted to do that DONT MAKE IT SO THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE BELLOW 18 SUFFER. the minimum i think would be 14 maybe 15 NOT 18 SO THE REST OF US NORMAL PEOPLE HAVE TO SUFFER! so many of the avatars we either took ages to find or even upload. striped away from us because is has a content warning! great idea guys. round of a applause! so in short. VR chat has become nothing more than an underage kids playground where they can throw away there parents cash at to pay for stuff THEY NEVER NEEDED. EVEN REC ROOM WOULDN'T STUPE TO THIS LEVEL OF SCUM! even better?! they LISTEN to there COMMUNITY! unlike SOME PEOPLE! i have grown up with this game. and it pains me to say it. but after today. after seeing the derection there taking this game. i might as well cancel my subscription and find a different game to play. cus after this? there is no recovering from this! they have hit rock bottom! the only way to fix this garbage is to just restart it. take the game back a few years! why not?! it worked for fortnite! and everyone looooooved that?!. so in total. . wait for them to fix these problems OR DITCH THIS GAME,Negative

VRChat,438100,"Early Access ReviewVRChat, a platform that once promised boundless creativity and social interaction in the virtual realm, has undergone significant changes, and not all for the better. As an immersive experience, it still has its merits, but certain aspects have left the community divided and, in some instances, disillusioned.One glaring issue that has cast a shadow over VRChat is the toxicity within its community. What was once a vibrant and welcoming space for creative minds to showcase their talents has become tainted by a noticeable influx of disruptive behavior. The rise of ""quest users"" seems to have exacerbated this problem, leading to a more challenging environment for those who simply want to enjoy the platform without dealing with disruptive individuals.One of the most lamentable consequences of this shift is the pervasive fear of crashers. Users are now more paranoid than ever, and the once carefree atmosphere is tinged with anxiety. This fear has had a profound impact on the ability of content creators to showcase their animations and hard work. The very essence of VRChat, which thrives on user-generated content and creativity, is compromised when users hesitate to share their creations due to the risk of interference.Furthermore, the prevalence of ""mirror dwellers"" has become a source of frustration for many. These individuals seem content to spend their time observing themselves in virtual mirrors rather than actively engaging with the community. This behavior contributes to the perception that the platform has lost its sense of community and interactivity, with users becoming more isolated in their virtual reflections.However, it's important to note that VRChat still retains its core appeal for those who seek genuine social interaction and creative expression. Despite the challenges posed by a more toxic subset of the community, there are still pockets of positivity where users connect over shared interests and experiences.In conclusion, VRChat is at a crossroads. While the toxic elements and disruptions have marred the once-pristine landscape of creative expression, there is still potential for the platform to rebound. The developers have a crucial role to play in maintaining a healthy community, implementing effective moderation tools, and addressing the concerns of users. Until then, VRChat remains a mixed bag, with both the promise of immersive experiences and the looming shadow of a less-than-ideal community experience.",Negative

The different classes are fun to juggle and that constant fear of characters going insane or dying is so rare to find in games but when it hits just right it adds another level on top of what is already a gerat game i wished i played sooner.Has really pushed me to try other games in this vein, like nadir, banners of ruin, slay the spire etc",Positive

Looks appealing, but hollow inside.",Negative

Darkest Dungeon®,262060,did not enjoy. screen is super busy and incoherent- every aspect of gameplay is either explained poorly or not at all. its totally unclear how attacks and the turn order work. the music is bad and full of annoying flourishes! which actively clash with the game's intended gloomy theme. the constant narration is obnoxious and cheesy.,Negative

Darkest Dungeon®,262060,"I really wanted to like this game, but there were some real issues that I'm guessing they've just fixed in Darkest Dungeon II instead.First of all, your biggest enemy isn't really the the enemies in the game, but the fact that your units get stressed out of orbit for pretty much just entering the dungeon or talking to each other. The game should from start have a way better tutorial and functions on how to relieve stress.Second problem, if you think the Random Number Generator is bad in XCOM, then you're going to have a real blast with this one. I know it's supposed to be a bit of the game failing and winning at random, but some runs have just been a complete waste of time entirely because of the RNG in addition to being new to the game.I would recommend this game for people who're getting back-seated while playing and for those who like to do pretty much the same repetitive thing over and over again.",Negative
Darkest Dungeon®,262060,The game is good at what it does but for a game as simplistic as this one it is severely overpriced.,Negative

Darkest Dungeon®,262060,"I played 60 hours. I played on the 'easiest' difficulty. I was drawn to this game by the very unique and beautiful art style, fantastic music, and great storytelling. I was aware this game has a reputation for being difficult. I even installed various mods to make it easier because I wanted a casual experience.It wasn't too bad at first, but turns out the game gets 'more difficult' as you progress by turning up the terrible game mechanics to an 11. Enemies start dodging ALL of your attacks, oneshotting or two shotting your entire party with critical hits back to back, the enemy always out speeds you later in the game and always goes first. Traditional elements of strategy you may see in other turn based rpgs becomes less and less important as you progress.It feels absolutely helpless and there's seriously no fun in throwing your highest level heroes at certain dungeons over and over again and having them all die. You spent 15 hours and went through 10 dungeons to level up a fresh party to go after a higher level dungeon? LOL here comes some terrible rng to throw away all of your efforts. Hard games are fun when they feel fair, and you feel rewarded for overcoming the challenge. There's none of that here. Only a smidgen of relief when you finally get lucky and don't get screwed over by unlucky 'randomness'.Final straw for me was losing an entire party of max level heroes, to back to back crits from a basic mob enemy. The basic baddie put my entire team on 'deaths door' in one hit, the turn order reset and he immediately took another turn and proceeded to wipe my party.",Negative

Darkest Dungeon®,262060,"I was really hopeful about this. But it feels like they took the worst parts of tactical turn based games, explained nothing, and then added a system that takes away what little agency you have. The RNG might kill you in your first encounter in a level 1 quest, and with no way in the early game to deal with speed and hit chance, it felt like whatever I tried wasn't important. The initiative system makes all of the combos I was eager to try pointless.Ultimately when you get to surprise an enemy group, miss all of your attacks, the entire enemy party goes, then goes again before you in the next round, drives your characters insane and they begin skipping turns or auto-passing, you just get to watch an AI battle kill you and fail. And even when you win, you'll just ""randomly"" roll 4 more negative quirks across the whole party.Thoroughly disappointed, the negatives far outweighed the parts I tried to enjoy.",Negative

Darkest Dungeon®,262060,"Surprisingly unfulfilling, went in with high expectations I suppose. The presentation is great and the narrator is iconic - but the gameplay?I mean, if you love losing hours of progress to funny number generators, sure, you're gonna be creaming over this one.

Darkest Dungeon®,262060,"I was instantly hooked when I started the game, but it all falls apart as soon as you make a mistakes later on.This game is well known for the permanent death mechanic. Early on and in the midgame, this is a fantastic mechanic that really punishes poor play while still giving the player plenty of opportunities to recover from their mistakes.Later in the game, though... If you loses a level 5 or 6 hero, you are looking at literal hours of grinding just to get back to where you were. It isn't interesting. It isn't fun. It doesn't create unique situations. It wastes the player's time with mindless grinding. By this point, you have most of the best trinkets, have seen almost every boss, and are just trying to finish up the game. Being forced to spend hours grinding for levels is not a fun mechanic, and the game does nothing to make leveling any faster.If you have tons of time on your hands, maybe this isn't such a terrible thing. Though, if you have that much time, play something more engaging and interesting.I want to love this game, but I just can't bring myself to finish it after losing a few max level characters to a combination of poor play on my part and an absurd amount of critical hits. Level grinding is an outdated mechanic that ruins the endgame of Darkest Dungeon.",Negative

Darkest Dungeon®,262060,Pretty one dimensional combat system do to lack of skill customization and very limited positioning option.Missions feel either boringly easy or unfairly hard.Really sucks that you can't see what you roll or how likely you are to succeed at anything.Not terrible just so many better tactical combat games out there.,Negative
Darkest Dungeon®,262060,One of the most overhyped games ever to release outside of anything Final Fantasy. The only thing carrying this game is the artstyle and the narrator...that is it...that is all that is worthwhile in this game.At the highest level of difficulty the only thing worth running are hit chance increases and building to stunlock the enemy while reducing stress and healing. That is it. Same thing every dungeon...no variety.Of the different character classes you can have in your party only like 4 or 5 are really useful. The rest are just not that great.No real replability despite the initial illusion that it might have some.Fanboys are cancerous simps.,Negative

Darkest Dungeon®,262060,"Great style and sound design, addictive loop but it failed to keep my interest toward the late game, dramatically.I can accept it's a game of rolling the dice and it can go both ways, I wish the game would accept that risk as well though, the later you get the more you have to lose and yet all the mechanics of the game bend the odds worse against you, the RNG is bent further against your favor with no benefit to you and the only way to keep up is equipment RNG, when the end game makes it very likely you will lose people it puts into perspective how much fun it is grinding a character back to max and rolling for the correct equipment to even give them a chance at success. Not to mention the rest of the team being functionally worthless until you train up a replacement for their comrade, since naturally as you get into the harder levels, less optimal strategies fall off in efficacy, though I do question the decision to make almost every status effect based team near useless by late game, starts to feel a lot like railroading. Not very fun, not at all. I'd go as far as to call it monotony. Whatever their goal with this game was I don't think it was boredom, yet that's about all the late game gives me, that and a desire to play anything else.",Negative
Darkest Dungeon®,262060,"the games designed around getting you to waste time. at its core, the game needs some polishing. by default lots of enemies have med-high resists which hinder certain characters from being effective. tack on additional penalties in accuracy for every skill that isnt level 2-3 and you get what i'm talking about by wasted time.the creators lack the insight to design battles off solid numbers so they padded resists and misses in as rng. extended battles with high rng isnt satisfying gameplay and i cant find 1 redeeming quality that feels good",Negative

Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition,1151640,I like the game play a good story in it. I see that there are missions which can be sometime tiresome and seems like that can take lot of time.

No other games do this on my PC. Outta ten id say around a 5 or 6 right now with the chance for it to be 7 or 8 if it worked properly and the story ending.I heard there were issues with the PC port when it came out, but no recent reviews show this so wanted to let people know in case they think its been completely fixed.

Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition,1151640,"It looks like an 8h game being stretched to become a 50h game.At first, the world-building looks promising, you wonder what happened to the world. However even if some questions are answered some don't make any sense and only are there for the sake of the gameplay, even if it's immersion-breaking.The gameplay looks great at the beginning but becomes tedious early on, you only have two hits with your spear, and bow gameplay becomes redundant very quickly.The skill progression is awful only the first row of skills changes the way you fight and are exciting, once you hit level 10 you're done, at level 40 you'll be playing the exact same way.The voice-acting is excellent but is mostly used to listen to people standing there, talking for hours without much happening.The graphics are... gorgeous, nothing negative here.The bottom line is, buy it on sale, play 10 hours at most and uninstall.

Sid Meier's Civilization VI,289070,"Overall a great game that's very enjoyable.  Building an empire feels very satisfying and there is a lot of depth that isn't immediately apparent, such that I am still learning new things about how game mechanics work despite being hundreds of hours deep in the game.  In some ways this might be seen as a bad thing in that it signifies there isn't a lot of transparency in the game on how things work, but that's not the case for the most part.  For the most part it's just that there are so many things to do that until you look each one up in the in-game civilopedia you only understand the basic concepts and not the behind-the-scenes mechanics.There are some things I would love to see improved in the next iteration, like combat.  Especially the way simultaneous-turn multiplayer combat is handled.  Right now in multiplayer it's kind of a click-fest to see who attacks with their units faster.  I can empathize with the devs because it's hard to come up with a perfect way to fix this.  When a combat starts, do you just kind of pause the game for everyone and wait for all units on either side to take turns making attacks?  That wouldn't be fun for players not in combat.  But if you allow players to just attack each other at full speed in real-time, it creates an element of a real-time-strategy game that feels out of place given that this game is turn-based.  My idea for this would be to just adjust the way that combat works to give less of an attacker's advantage except in the most extreme circumstances.  For example, if a slinger attacks a warrior, the warrior shouldn't just sit there and lose half its health.  They should engage each other simultaneously so it doesn't matter if the player with the warrior clicked first or the player with the slinger clicked first.  The only times this wouldn't be the case is when attacking from more than 1 range, such as an archer 2 hexes away, in which case having a melee attacker run all the way across 2 hexes wouldn't make sense and some advantage should go to the player that is using range.  That being said, if an archer is attacking something that can attack back like another archer, they should simultaneously attack each other whenever either player attacks so that it's more fair and isn't just ""who clicked first"" or ""who is host and has less delay.""But other than the multiplayer combat issues and some minor multiplayer desync issues the game is a blast",Positive

So the next day I tried playing a game with what I have learned and was able to save the game but after saving it and trying to get back to my desktop everything locked up and I had to shut down my computer. So the next day I tried loading the previous day's save and it worked so I then tried getting back to my desktop again and again everything locked up.  This is when I requested a refund as I could not play, save, completely shut down my computer and restart it again each time I played.  There must be a bug.

Sid Meier's Civilization VI,289070,"Civ VI is a pretty significant step backwards from Civ V in playability. The continued push to increase the complexity of the game mechanics prevents teaching friends to play, eliminates the possibility of casual play, and creates too many variables to keep track of to make it enjoyable. The UI buries key stats, spreading them across tons of views or buried deep in info menus that are often unreachable from the point at which you are making critical decisions like choosing a policy or government. You will mind yourself doing a ton of hand calcs trying to determine if a policy will be great for you or horrendous. You will accidentally screw over your own cities on seemingly small decisions since impacts are difficult to discover until after you've made a change. The decision to still tie city boundary growth to culture and limit city reach to 3 tiles while making every wonder and district take up a tile means that world building or even city building is a disaster.This is no longer a civ building game but a multi-variable calculus class masquerading as a game.To round it off, the game is often buggy, though not enough to significantly impede it.",Negative

Set adrift on a makeshift raft in an endless ocean, the game delivers a visually stunning experience that draws players into a world teeming with marine life and danger.The gameplay mechanics are the heart of ""Raft,"" offering a perfect mix of scavenging, crafting, and survival. Starting with just a hook, players gradually build their floating sanctuary, constantly juggling the need for resources and the ever-present threats of hunger and dehydration. The intuitive crafting system keeps things dynamic, making each decision feel crucial to your virtual survival.One standout feature is the cooperative multiplayer mode, allowing friends to join the adventure. Together, you can build, explore, and face the challenges of the ocean, creating a sense of camaraderie that enhances the overall experience.While ""Raft"" excels in many aspects, the early game can be a bit slow, requiring patience as you gather resources. Some may also find the limited variety in environments and the repetitive nature of resource gathering a bit monotonous over time.In conclusion, ""Raft"" stands out as a captivating survival experience with its stunning visuals, engaging mechanics, and cooperative multiplayer option. If you're a fan of survival games, ""Raft"" is a must-play that offers the thrill of exploration and the satisfaction of building your own floating haven in a beautifully unforgiving ocean.",Positive

Raft,648800,"I haven't played this game for very long, but I ran into a serious bug where I couldn't harvest anything. So had to rely on my team to gather food and a lot of the resources for me. But regardless of the bug I don't think it would change my opinion of the game very much. This game is boring. The crafting mechanics are fine, but there's nothing that separates it from other games that have crafting. There doesn't appear to be any sort of goal other than survive as long as you can. It's visually boring. All islands look basically the same and when you're not on an island it's REALLY BORING. I guess if you really love survival style games and crafting maybe you'll enjoy this, but there just isn't any depth to this game.Maybe the game gets more interesting the longer you play, but it's so boring so quickly that it doesn't feel worth it to keep going.",Negative

Raft,648800,"The game was released in Early Access on June 20, 2022.  I waited a while before picking it up.  There had been discussions in the forum threads regarding Controller Support.  Controller support was stated to be added at a later date.  It is now November 25, 2023 and still no controller support.  The game isn't bad, but lacking modern controls and extra features found in other games has soured my experience in this game.  Maybe some day we'll see full controller support in this title.  I'll play it more then, and if the controls work properly I'll change this review.",Negative

Raft,648800,"DUMB overrated game. I was playing on easy mode and got stuck on an endless loop of a shark eating me. It doesn't matte how many resources you have on you, you cannot build a raft without finding one... which in my case, probably didn't exist.You cannot at any point start from scratch. You have to baby sit your piece of scrap wood regardless of how many times more resources you have on you.  You cannot place planter boxes on an island or grow anything on an island. You cannot build rafts on an island. You cannot fish while sitting down. You cannot sit down on an island. You cannot place inventory on an island.Getting over it is a less frustrating game with less glitches.",Negative
Raft,648800,butt,Negative
Raft,648800,This game is absolutely horrible. At one point I had no boat and could not build anything. I had been playing for an hour so I am uninstalling and leaving this bad review. Never buy this game unless free but still it just takes up storage. The equivillant of this would be to store every single dump you took in your entire life and had it so that people could buy your dumps and place them around their house. You would most likely catch a felony for this just like how your gonna catch a felony if you try to have fun playing this game. Would not reccomend.,Negative

Raft,648800,"Progression is non existent, game is too difficult to follow with close to no clues. Without guides online and even with it is completely useless. Only completed it for the sake of it but I feel a bitterness inside of me for even spending the time I did on this game. Mediocre would not describe it right. I would have preferred to play cookie clicker for the time said as it would have been more fun and engaging than this pile of hot steaming raft.I cannot refund the time I have wasted. But this is the best I can attempt. Please take my review into consideration. There just is not much even building or creativity wise its just letting Jesus take the wheel.",Negative
Raft,648800,Its just alright. No matter what difficulty i feel like all i get done is eating and drinking. Its just kind of tedious and boring. It has potential and maybe a raft 2 would be the game i want. But this one doesn't hold my attention.

Raft,648800,this game has been out for 5 years and still missing a lot of key basics needed in a survival game.  1.items cant be repair it breaks so you need to make a whole another one. you can simply get in the water to collect resources due to raft floating away and the shark that follows you through out the entire ocean. the one time use of an anchor to hold the raft in place is just crazy. then you need to make a new one. i like the concept of the game but it still needs alot of work after 5 years,Negative
Raft,648800,Another instance of steam needing a middling buttonFun with other people. One of the genuine worst starts to any survival game alone though. Love items despawning because I turned my back for two seconds when my inventory was full and went to put something away.I have had a lot of fun playing this with my wife in the past. Tried playing solo as our work schedules don't line up and it's terrible.,Negative
Raft,648800,"What an awful game.I decided to load it up to try playing again. Within 15 minutes I'm floating by a large island with a bird that drops rocks on me.

Raft,648800,"This is one of those games that is really hard to recommend unless you have friends who can play it with you. The mechanics and controls can be a bit wonky, the visuals are a tad generic with not a lot of personality and combat encounters can be really rough, especially since this game doesn't really feel like it was built for it. The map is also huge, so huge and seemingly endless that it's super easy to get lost, making it rather difficult to keep yourself on track for the overall quests and questline. I guess if you don't mind getting lost on the ocean for long periods of time and have some friends who aren't super concerned about story progression, maybe you could get a few nights of fun out of it. Solo wise, I wouldn't bother.",Negative
Raft,648800,"Fine concept, but not so great execution. This game is one of those games that makes you want to play more, but punishes you on literally every step.You can build raft from floating garbage, but once you got stranded on an island you are doomed - you cannot build new raft.You can chop trees, but not this one! This one is special.You can make fine and advanced tools, but they got damaged in no time.You can use an axe to chop trees, but not to destroy dense foliage - you need another special tool for this task!But the main problem of this game is optimization - a game which in theory run on a potato struggles to maintain constant framerate on a Radeon RX6650XT. In other words, the game exited the 'early access', but 'early access' did not exit the game.",Negative

Instead I have to use a button, then another button to select an item. It is confusing. It is the same with weapon and item selection...Confusion. Why not have a menu similar to Fallout 4 and 76. Simple! I hope that this wheel menu is not the future of gaming. Aiming is crap to put it politely. I will continue to follow the story, but it will take months.

Red Dead Redemption 2,1174180,"The pace is awful and the controls are bad.  I was hoping for a GTA or Cyberpunk experience but this is not it.  I almost wouldn't mind the pacing except for the awful controls.  The button to climb is not always the button to climb, but it's also the button to pick up so if you're trying to get something out of the box in the back of a wagon, you wind up climbing on the wagon repeatedly instead.  Then you go to climb in a train car and now it's a different button.  It doesn't help a lot of the controls are locked situationally, so you can't just rest when you want, you can't check your weapon loadout at the camp locker and buying and selling is painfully difficult.  Melee for some reason is one key but weapons are another, I don't know if the hand let you melee with the attack key but the few times I've gotten into something it gives a separate control for melee, and instead of using my hands I drew my pistol mid punch and pistol whipped the enemy.  Nothing feels right, the horse is always trying to go the wrong direction, and there is a lot of going on the horse.  Every time I get up someone or something happens and I get off the horse.  Once I wound up dead because the enemies started shooting during the animation.  I just find the whole thing tedious and confusing.  It's a shame too because it really could be beautiful, but you know there is your outfit, your outfits, the outfit you're supposed to have on your horse for weather changes, and no clear controls for any of it.  I'm probably the next to last person to pick up RDR2, but if you're thinking about it maybe don't and leave me the last.",Negative

So many mechanics, yet so little instruction. lame",Negative
Red Dead Redemption 2,1174180,"As fun as the core game is, so many of its mechanics are purposely built to make your experience of playing the game as miserable as possible. The movement system is terrible. Throughout. Walking, running, or even riding a horse is painfully clunky at the best of times.The crime system is genuinely horrible. Self-defense is discouraged completely. It's better to allow yourself to be shot down than risk incurring the long arm of the law getting you instead. Trying to do anything even marginally illegal will get the entire county on your behind in spite of no witnesses actually being nearby to see you or carrying a mask over your face.As much as this game is about outlaws and their struggle, it's about making you struggle just as much as them to enjoy the experience. Just get RDR1 or GTA5 if you want to play a RockStar game, because this is genuinely a miserable experience far too often to justify the price tag.",Negative

Lies of P,1627720,"Really enjoyed this game.  Definitely had the souls feel going on with it's own twist.  I liked all the different enemy types, and the variety of weapons, and legion arms. I've always preferred dodging than blocking so it took some getting used to, to get down the perfect blocks for that benefit.  Initially I thought it was quite easy, but there were some bosses, and even elites that gave me a run for my money.  Great game!",Positive
Lies of P,1627720,"Lies of P is very satisfying to play on a moment-to-moment basis and offers an addictive sense of progression in your personal skills as well as the story. It brings very few new ideas to the table but what it borrows from other works it executes wonderfully.One of my main critiques is that there are a lot of two-phase boss fights where if you die in the second phase you have to redo the first before you can try again. This gets exceedingly tedious, particularly in the penultimate fight of the game, which gets boring after the first couple of times you beat it since all of the boss's attacks are very samey and drawn out, and its health pool is predictably bloated.Lowering the required number of parries for the boss's weapon to break, then concluding the phase after the player manages to meet that requirement could rectify this issue. To be clear, the boss's weapon shouldn't remain broken in the following phase.",Positive

Lies of P,1627720,"This one is fantastic. The graphics are solid, the actual fighting mechanics are great, I enjoyed that there was a story, and I would recommend to most.The only small thing I would point out is I felt like some enemies had almost unlimited stamina.

Lies of P,1627720,"They somehow took the souls formula and cooked up something that is basically a distilled version of all the things that make playing souls games fun. Instead of having a lot of obscure quests that you never know when and where to trigger, they tell you. Instead of needing to master every mechanic to barely survive, they allow you to complete the game much more attuned to your personal flow. And yes, the flow is definitely there, like being on an adventure cruise instead of being lost in an adventure jungle.I really liked it.",Positive
Lies of P,1627720,"The game is Hard af and brings a new element to the souls like genre with a heavier focus on narrative.

Lies of P,1627720,this game is almost entirely great but my god the final boss is not just hard it is frustrating. through out the whole game you get a summon for bosses but of course you don't get one for the final boss. the tracking is completely absurd so you better hope you are good at perfectly timing your blocks. and also the final boss is significantly faster than every other boss so no more charged heavy attacks for you. talk about artificial difficulty spike. i just decided to get the bad ending because it was easier than having to fight the guy.,Negative
Lies of P,1627720,Product refundedI really wanted to play this game. I refunded it after 40 minutes of gameplay because the camera was not working as I was controlling.

Lies of P,1627720,"I made it through most of the game before giving up due to buggy bosses.Pros- Story is interesting- Some neat combat ideasCons- The game itself isn't very difficult. It's just buggy combat- Zero stagger resistance against any attacks. If you get touched while swinging, oh well. Yet basic enemies take multiple power attacks with a heavy weapon to stagger.- Attacks not registering WAY TOO FREQUENTLY. Imagine a heavy swing at a boss at point blank range that swooshes through the air. Again, and again, and again, until you give up and write this review.- Bosses will switch attacks mid-animation. Seems they can cancel any attack at any point, and switch to any other attack. Just a jumbled garble of random half swings.- Seems every enemy has a small random chance to initiate a one-hit-kill instant out-of-nowhere attack if you're close range.- I did a particular quest where I needed to talk to a particular person, but when I showed up they attacked me.

I play these games for difficult fight but if I need to put in 26 button cheat code to unlock the hard part of the boss, I just don't want to play.

Lies of P,1627720,"The only thing i really liked is the art and that's it. The game design and mechanics is too clunky, almost impossible to parry attacks because they happen in 2 frames in 240 fps game. The story and ending was also disappointing. Idk why people compare this to soul games, it's almost impossible to get the same satisfaction from fights. I had NO satisfaction when defeating bosses, NONE. The game is hard but not in a way you expect, you just randomly lose hp because of stupid surroundings or mobs that are just hiding behind the wall and do a jump scare.",Negative
Lies of P,1627720,Cool game but it sucks so so so much to defeat a boss and then keep playing just to die 10 minutes late in some other areaof the map and return aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaall the way back! The game should auto save from time to time and not just every 2 hours,Negative

Lies of P,1627720,"These developers should have their studio burned down. This game is a trashy waste of time. They just took the worst combat feature in any Soulslike, the parry, and made that the main mechanic that combat revolves around.As someone who has never parried ANY enemy is ANY Soulslike because the timing is absolute trash is every game it's featured it, well, it remains true here. All these idiots who say ""jUsT PaRrY BeFoRe yOu GeT hIt"" are too stupid to understand that input lag and slowed reaction time due to age make that IMPOSSIBLE.Hogwarts Legacy has a better, more responsive dodge than ANY Soulslike could ever wish to have.Devs really are too stupid to know how to make games anymore. You're supposed to take the BEST from other games, not the worst. I'm not going to spend hours on ONE boss just to learn how to parry its r e tt a r d e d attacks.",Negative
Lies of P,1627720,"So many gaming sins here.Claw grip controls...This game is getting nominated left and right, whilst it dedicates to a controller scheme where you can't run and move the camera at the same time...And no pause button - ""duuh bloodborne didnt have one so we wont have one either duuh"" if this game is just going to 'follow the crowd' blindly then theres no hope for uniqueness here. The only way this game so far tries to be unique is in its pretentiousness, taking things like health and mana and renaming it into nonsense confusing stat names.And the stamina decreases way too quickly for how slow you run and boringly wide these environments are. This is such basic stuff to completely fumble right off the bat, why should I waste more time when around every corner is a new terribly implemented gaming thing.Also, they charge you extra for the non-refundable deluxe upgrade in the UK compared to the US. Hope the greed was worth it.Im not fanboi, lords of the fallen, the mess that it is, is more unique and daring than this, and allows you to pause and run whilst moving camera and has quality of life things like items remaining in place even after dying  And doesnt try to be pretentious - my point being that lies of p isn't really trying to do anything other than look unique without actually being anything",Negative

Lies of P,1627720,"This game attempts to be difficult without making the difficulty fun or rewarding. Unlike other soulslike games, this game just feels like a complete slog to get through. Most of the difficulty is built upon bosses having large healthpools or having unintuitive move set timing. Effectively this game just forces you to memorize timings and then execute them correctly for 5 to 10 minutes straight. Memorization was not fun in school, and it is not fun in a game.",Negative
Lies of P,1627720,Went to Red Lobster would be a plus! In all honesty tho the game is great. But a lot of things fall short. Fix the parry window. For a game that expects you to parry a lot... its broken. The dodge as well. Such minor things holding back a wonderful game. Its been almost 2 months since release and no patches... No interest to listen to the community and fix simple things. Ill change my review upon some sort of patch...,Negative
Lies of P,1627720,"It is truly a good game but the boss fights just feels unfair, no matter how much you dodge you will get hit once and then half your health is gone.

Lies of P,1627720,"If you enjoy the combat of Souls games and dislike the exploration aspects, this will be a great experience.Game  has  good combat and world design, great atmosphere.The level design is terrible.Most areas have a single correct path to take, with an occasional side room containing  an enemy and chest that gives you a consumable you will never use. You navigate a gorgeous corridor filled with enemies to get to a mini-boss, after killing the mini-boss the doors to the next corridor open automatically. Rinse and repeat.  No interconnected world or even exploration of the separate levels most of the time.Half way trough the game your weapons are powerful enough to 3 hit combo most enemies so you stop engaging with the combat system, outside of bosses, which combines with the simple level design to make parts of the game tedious. I just ran trough chunks of the later levels as I could not be asked to fight copy pasted enemies in a corridor again.",Negative
