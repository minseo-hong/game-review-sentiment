"So far minor errors, but recovered with no issues. Issues connecting to server after starting a mycareer game. I haven't played the blacktop modes yet. No issues with simming to next appearance in my career. Great mechanics, still a grind. We will see how the career mode goes after a season or 2. Im about 25 games in no issues other than having to reload the game but started right where i left off, which i was very pleased. Also had to confirm account in email spam folder, weird. 30 bucks cant beat it.Edited, so i tried 2 blacktop 3v3 games everyone black screened at the beginning of intro celebrations both times. Needless to say i still havent gotten to ball up with online players. 30 bucks for half the game, 30 bucks off for online portion not working sounds about right. you get what you get for a ""new"" game. smh",Positive
"It's disheartening to acknowledge that FC24 has earned the dubious distinction of being deemed one of the worst games in history. The game's apparent downfall lies not only in its uninspiring change in the outlook but, more critically, in its abysmal gameplay. Players have expressed widespread dissatisfaction with the overall gaming experience, citing issues ranging from clunky controls to lackluster mechanics. The game's attempt at a revamped visual presentation seems to have fallen short of redeeming its flaws, ultimately contributing to an overall sense of disappointment among the gaming community. FC24's descent into the realm of the worst games in history is a testament to the importance of striking a delicate balance between aesthetics and gameplay to ensure an enjoyable and immersive experience for players.",Negative
One of the best story driven games i have ever played,Positive

"What makes this game kind of a turd is that you can't play it offline, even in single player mode. Otherwise, it would be great. I'm going to start rating every game down that Ubisoft makes like this. Not here for the multiplayer. Would never spend money on a multiplayer. Single player, or PFO. The idea that their servers are also weak and kick you out frequently even with a good connection is unacceptable. That is the reason for the down vote. I would love to give this a thumb up, because it is mostly fun.",Negative
"I wanted to like this game. I hoped it would be a better Elite Dangerous. Something I could sink my teeth into for hours before a satisfying ending. I can't play this game. Even with enough mods to remake this game, I can't enjoy it.The weapons are all various flavors of vanilla, and with the bullet sponge enemies they all feel like you are flinging farts. An unbearable number of missions involve more loading screens than gameplay. The main quest story is what killed this for me.I say this with as little spoilers as possible, but the main plot is just Rick and Morty.They had all of space to work with, alien discoveries, or space plague to use as a plot... and they chose Rick and Morty BS.Fallout 76 at launch was a better game than this will ever be.",Negative

"Play Battlefield V instead. It's prettier, better designed, has more content and features. Or play BF1. Or BF3.

"This game has got huge potential, but it is simply not ready yet, even after a few patches many bugs still occurs, performance is quite alright thou.If this was released as an early access it had been quite alright, but not as a full game, as such i expect it to properly function, thus at the question steams give us i cant recommend it in the current state, sorry!",Negative

"Performance aside, this game is a massive step up from CS 1.The simulation and building types are so specific that it makes you very immersed. Making downtown areas is super easy and you don't have to have 20 DLCs to enjoy the game like the previous one. If you have the correct PC for it, would recommend definitely",Positive

I wouldn't buy this for 20 bucks now and before I should've refunded it because it feels like god of war but if the writing was terrible and that says alot about the game.,Negative
"Progression is non existent, game is too difficult to follow with close to no clues. Without guides online and even with it is completely useless. Only completed it for the sake of it but I feel a bitterness inside of me for even spending the time I did on this game. Mediocre would not describe it right. I would have preferred to play cookie clicker for the time said as it would have been more fun and engaging than this pile of hot steaming raft.I cannot refund the time I have wasted. But this is the best I can attempt. Please take my review into consideration. There just is not much even building or creativity wise its just letting Jesus take the wheel.",Negative

"3 day ban for ""unusual gameplay patterns"" when I first played the game after like a year. I paid for this game when it first came out, I wonder if I can still get my money back for literally preventing me from what I paid for when I did nothing wrong.

"I played Diablo 4 on Free Weekend with two characters. One Rogue to Level 14 and a Mage to Level 10.The game is beautiful, even on my old machine. Aside from the ""too much talking""-scenes the story is decently woven in with cut scenes.But my god is the gameplay utter garbage. You have no real skill variety and the game itself has scaling. Making Level and Gear progression absolutly useless in a genre where its all about Leveling and Gearing up.Play Last Epoch or Path of Exile. Diablo 4 is not worth your money AND time. If it is for the story, watch a 2 hour youtube storyvideo about it.",Negative

"I can't understand how this game is getting so many good reviews.Broken game...Only able to make 3 subs in Champions League games. IRL you can make 5 subs in CL games.Reload simulator...The devs still think it's fun to implement random 3 month training injuries. Doesn't matter whether it would or would not happen irl, IT'S NOT FUN! Just load a pre-injury save.Clubs haemorrhage money...Even if you win a competition you'll have to pay the squad a collective bonus that's more than you received for winning the competition. Unmanageable if you want a squad that can challenge at the top level, as they all want the huge pot of gold.Ridiculous player demands...Even 16 year old future prospects demand 80k weekly wages.So many clicks...Everyday is at least 20 clicks. The game still doesn't navigate to your inbox when there's a message there. You have to click off all the bs the game is showing you to view every single message.",Negative

"Performance is not optimal, but that doesn't even bother me too much. The fact that the world somehow feels dead bothers me much more. Amongst other problems, the meagre amount of commuters, the broken economy and weird zoning issues make this game really unfinished and unpolished.

I know it's DnD, but I guess I just like live action in my video games over the turn-based.  Otherwise, it looks like a great game.

"It's been a month and this game is still broken. This is not a completed game. It's an alpha game at best. The finances seem to be just... made up? They often do not add up or make sense. Cars drive around aimlessly, switching lanes constantly and causing traffic jams for no apparent reason. You cannot control lanes so even if most traffic is turning right you will have a bunch of lanes for going straight or whatever. Car will randomly just stop in the middle of the road and won't move, you have to delete the road to get rid of them. Chirper is useless, they complain and praise anything and everything but you can't turn the stupid thing off. The education system doesn't make any real world sense whatsoever. You have to put down like 10 elementary schools because they keep filling up but hardly anyone is going to highshcool for some reason. Unemployment can be high but people still endlessly complain there are not enough workers. People will stand in the middle of an industry zone complaining about pollution an noise. A lot of features and assets from the original base game are not here AND no mods to fix them. Do not buy unless they fix it!",Negative

If Rockstar would develop a system that would block illegal mods this game would be so much better on line. I hope GTA6 would have something in place that would make this happen.,Negative
"The pace is awful and the controls are bad.  I was hoping for a GTA or Cyberpunk experience but this is not it.  I almost wouldn't mind the pacing except for the awful controls.  The button to climb is not always the button to climb, but it's also the button to pick up so if you're trying to get something out of the box in the back of a wagon, you wind up climbing on the wagon repeatedly instead.  Then you go to climb in a train car and now it's a different button.  It doesn't help a lot of the controls are locked situationally, so you can't just rest when you want, you can't check your weapon loadout at the camp locker and buying and selling is painfully difficult.  Melee for some reason is one key but weapons are another, I don't know if the hand let you melee with the attack key but the few times I've gotten into something it gives a separate control for melee, and instead of using my hands I drew my pistol mid punch and pistol whipped the enemy.  Nothing feels right, the horse is always trying to go the wrong direction, and there is a lot of going on the horse.  Every time I get up someone or something happens and I get off the horse.  Once I wound up dead because the enemies started shooting during the animation.  I just find the whole thing tedious and confusing.  It's a shame too because it really could be beautiful, but you know there is your outfit, your outfits, the outfit you're supposed to have on your horse for weather changes, and no clear controls for any of it.  I'm probably the next to last person to pick up RDR2, but if you're thinking about it maybe don't and leave me the last.",Negative

This game is unplayable. The entire battle system is based on a limited amount of moves that can only be used one time. After that you just use regular attacks. Fights are few and far between so leveling up on low level fights isn't an option. Most of the story is a third person narrative that gets old extremely fast. i don't know how this game got so many good reviews. I would get a return but it took me 11 hours to realized that it wasn't getting better. I'm definitely not buying a digital only game again. At least with a physical copy i could trade it in or something. Huge waste of time and money.,Negative

The game while just as fun as the first with some cool improvements shipped in a broken status missing a bunch of key upgrade features.

"Let me start out by saying I love Cities Skylines 1. I have over 600 hours in that game. This game was not ready for release. I can't come close to playing it with any amount of reasonable graphics settings and I don't have a crappy system. I mean, I can run Satisfactory with the graphics cranked up with no issues, but not this? I can't even get over 25 frames with a population of 10,000. I've had multiple freezes and shut downs, also. The game feels like it's missing tons of content. I can't really explain that other than it just feels lacking of numerous items and options. Maybe this will be a good game eventually, but not today. You really dropped the ball on this one CO.",Negative

"Boy is this game slow! The workers build things in a moment and disappear after three builds. Everything looks cartoonish and funny-looking. Between you and whatever you have to do, there's always a plethora of screens, messages to be read or people talking to you. They just took Civ V and made it boring.",Negative

there is lots of chiken eater in this game,Positive
graphics and optimization is always top notch with insomniac..Buuuut this game compared to original spider man is way too short for the price also  compared to the first game i can't call any of the fights in this game a boss fight.This game should have been a dlc to the first game and the dlcs in the first game should have been added as a side quest instead.There is no humour in this game first game even though it heavily used family friendly language and i don't recall that game being this bad in humour and story wise.pass this one just play the first you won't miss anything in my honest opinion,Negative

"Easily one of the best games of 2023. The more you get into it, the more things you discover. It's a genre hybrid game which expands to 5 different games put into a single one. The environment, soundtrack, gameplay loop and mechanics are solid and very fun. The same fishing mechanic never gets boring and the game keeps introducing new mechanics to it. It's challenging at times as well. This game is treat for yourself.",Positive

"This game cannot get out of its own way. Why take the time and spend the energy to create a fun, inventive game only to hamstring it at every possible opportunity. At heart, this game is fun. You should get it, try it and play it for as long as you are able to enjoy it. Sooner or later some horrible design is gonna make you froth at the mouth. But I like this game. Or at least enough pieces of it. Even if I don't like the whole.",Negative
"COOO, AND FUNNNNNEYYYYYYYYYYY",Positive
"The first two acts are excellent, where passion and expertise manage to shine through. The third act fumbles what came before. It's evident that the final acts lies unfinished and rushed. Much of the side content and characters don't receive conclusions or resolutions. The writing suffers the most. Certain character's actions at one of the endings are illogical. Imagine if William Wallace decided to accept king's pardon and proceeded to join him. The complete betrayal of an established character's motivations.I'll leave a negative review for the time being because of the final act's drop in quality. The review will update if the game gets polished, improved and expanded, as was promised by Larian.This is not to say that the whole of the game is bad or that it's not worth playing. Few developers remain who show respect for their audience's time and investment.",Negative

"I was excited and played the game nonstop for about the first week, after completing the main story there's not that much to do. The end game planets are underutilized and empty beyond belief, while yes you can explore them its the same copy pasted points of interest that get boring to explore after the first 10 hours. I feel as if some of the side missions are much more interesting than the main quest was and new game plus is replaying the same boring story doing the same boring things and there is honestly no need to do it. There are still many quests and game bugs that have yet to be patched that make some missions impossible to complete. You may stumble upon some abandoned ships from time to time while exploring the orbits of the planets but you cant take them, even with max piloting perks for no apparent reason.I do hope the game gets the much needed improvements in the future but for now I would not recommend a purchase of this title, instead just buy skyrim or fallout games with flushed out atmospheres and points of interest that aren't copied and pasted prefabs.",Negative

"Fine concept, but not so great execution. This game is one of those games that makes you want to play more, but punishes you on literally every step.You can build raft from floating garbage, but once you got stranded on an island you are doomed - you cannot build new raft.You can chop trees, but not this one! This one is special.You can make fine and advanced tools, but they got damaged in no time.You can use an axe to chop trees, but not to destroy dense foliage - you need another special tool for this task!But the main problem of this game is optimization - a game which in theory run on a potato struggles to maintain constant framerate on a Radeon RX6650XT. In other words, the game exited the 'early access', but 'early access' did not exit the game.",Negative
The best CRPG game i have yet to play.,Positive

They don't care about their pc fan-base. Only money",Negative
"Early Access ReviewHow the times have changed... How to tables have turned... VR chat isn't what it used to be anymore, and it all have to do with choices that feels so much like mistakes, and the anti-consumercy is real.VRChat used to be something beautiful, a perfect place to socialize and interact with people. Although there were bad apples in there, who always causes pain, and drama, I always seem to find the good and continuing in meeting new people. However, that has changed.VRchat is basically a sellout. They're marketing strategy has shifted to a more pay to use type of thing. And now, with the recent updates that have been released which nobody knows that their privacy is basically being invaded by something they didn't know that they gave consent towards.You probably remember agreeing to some terms and services before being giving permission to enter inside VRChat. All I'm going to say is, those who played Black Cat Cafe or whatever it is named, everything that was once free, is no more. There is a paywall to gain access to the things that were free since the beginning of time. And to gain access to the things that are locked you have to pay more money, and if you are to ever go to check out this VRChat plus, you shall see a new logo called ""V"", which I believe is stands for Virtual Currency.That's right, VRChat has just became a whole new thing full of pay walls, to gain access to things that were once free. Asking ridiculous amounts, even after they basically have given us nothing. The game constantly still crashes, so nothing new there. Ever since the day allowed Anti Cheat to become a thing, it has done nothing but ruin everything that made VRchat amazing and usable. Even though I understand the reason why, as long as it exists, VRChat will continue to crash.The very essence of what made VRchat great, is gone, it's slowly vanishing. And you have the developers to blame, because they obviously don't care about us. They don't care about what we want, they don't care about what we need, they don't care about anything so long as they can profit from it. At this point the only comparison I can compare this to is a application that used to be known or wide during those whom attended high school years.Those who are familiar with an app called ""Amino"", know exactly where I'm going with this. Used to be free, easy access, nothing to worry about, but BOOM! Your hit with many things, in-app currency, to make yourself look cool, just like how ""Discord"" was once free, but Saw the popularity grow to where it led them to profit from whatever it is they can. Although this doesn't clearly count as nowhere near as worse as Amino, and the route VRChat devs are going in towards.It just feels like one of those things where it's all about getting money now, it's time to profit, it doesn't matter how old the game is, so long as they add new things to make it seem like it's worth every penny spent. That's all that matters to them.If I'm being honest, it's completely pointless. The VRChat already has VRChat Plus. What more can they add? To what more they could need?In fair honesty, it's terrible choices. And this is the norm of how groups of developers do things. Even companies make horrible choices, but even then they can make amends and make things right to actually make a difference.Of course these are my own thoughts and feelings on the choices that they are making.VRChat is still unusable, it lags, it force kicks people out, and it's only getting worser with every update that doesn't actually fix anything or stabilizes things. VRChat feels more of a cash grab now, and it feels more like a mobile port than anything else.One thing I will make clear is, it doesn't hurt to support content creators. But, if a world that's already been out for a long time, only to then be swapped edited, with newer paywalls to gain access the things that were once free is absurd. Shame on you. Shame on the choices you've made. Do better. Because it feels like you really don't care about us, if you are more than willing to violate our privacy, VRChat Devs.Actually do something that will make the people of the VRC community feel safe. That's all I will say, overall I hope you all have an amazing rest of your day. And thank you for reading.",Negative
"Made me less excited for ES6. I am a lifelong BGS fan but boys, I think it's over. To say Starfield was a disappointment would be putting it very lightly. Cookie cutter, empty planets, loading screens galore, boring NPC's and quests, your choices are mostly irrelevant. I don't think I encountered anything in Starfield that made me care about an outcome one way or the other. Every BGS game since Morrowind has been steadily removing more features and continuing dumbing down. Sad state the video game world is in these days.",Negative

I for one am obsessed with collectibles and have been searching for a game with lots of them so if you are like me this game is definitely for you. Overall I highly recommend this game.",Positive

"The games still has bugs where the goalkeeper passes to opposition players more often than in reality and the shot count vs. goals is too high as well. But the most displeasing thing is the player interaction, which basically whittles down any pleasure in long term playing. The players complain all the time for various reasons and you can placate them once, for them to complain again. Everyone wants to play all the time, even if they play poorly. Training results don't matter at all, as the ones that are marked as Important players and train poorly still expect to play and if you bench them, they complain that they are unhappy. Team morale plummets very fast, even if you win, if there's an unhappy top player.",Negative

"Biggest load of trash on the steam shop currently. Having a good computer makes this hot load run significantly worse. It chugs until you fix the frame rate cap and follows up by preventing you from getting in the game because it's under the impression you're using ""cheats"" simply for changing frame rate cap in STEAMS OWN SETTINGS. Don't buy at all cost and quite possibly call it quits on bethesda for this attrocity",Negative

"This is easily the best game I have played this year. The ""indie"" aspect aside, the quality of the pixel art and animation is simply breathtaking. There is a lot of heart put in making this game, and the variety of gameplay elements and new content that tries to keep the experience fresh must be applauded. Even the closing credits are fun. In the sterile environment of the AAA money funnels, and cashgrabby life services, games like this must be cherished, praised and appreciated. I would not mind having a second course now!",Positive
"As a long time fallout fan, i enjoyed the gameplay. but again micro transactions lock me up. im sorry i dont wanna pay monthly fee to enjoy fallout sure i can play without it, sadly it will put you in a bind where you are going to struggle selling everything you horde just to fit in a small stash to progress. the materials it requires you to build you cant save enough for a full set so your ether going to lose materials to get what u want temp or u just hope you find the item without building it.12.99 a month seems a bit much all considering i dont mind the cash shop for cosmetics but this is where your paying for advantage with the storage system which is a backbone. not worth the price of the game if its going to cost you monthly.",Negative

"I may edit the review in the future but so far I can't recommend the game on PC. The gameplay itself is fine but I've run into a few issues with audio glitches, the game causing other applications or website loading times to be increased, and recently the game showing a black screen for a few seconds and then coming back. No other games do this on my PC. Outta ten id say around a 5 or 6 right now with the chance for it to be 7 or 8 if it worked properly and the story ending.I heard there were issues with the PC port when it came out, but no recent reviews show this so wanted to let people know in case they think its been completely fixed.

"Boring, empty, bad writing, uninteresting characters, and way, way too many copy and pasted assets. This whole game is basically the same 30 props used over and over for every dungeon. Fallout reuses assets too but at least the world was detailed enough to feel original unlike Starfield. Also the gas lighting Bethesda is doing in this review section by trying to tell you how you experienced the game is wrong, it's just pathetic. Your big flagship game that you over hyped flopped hard, and now you're trying to tell people who didn't like the game that you know best and that the fans are wrong because big daddy Microsoft might come after you. You look like clowns.",Negative
"I held off buying this for awhile because I generally don't trust blizzard and I don't like giving them money. I bought this on sale, and wow am I happy with it.

This is actually a really good entry in the Fallout series. I'm not sure how much better an online multiplayer Fallout game could be. Do yourself a favor, and play this game.",Positive

Writing the review in the hopes that BGS makes a chatGPT response. By the way No man's sky is more next gen than Starfield AND it came out on the PS4 and is even on the switch. Why are there so many loading screens and fake loading screens as well? I can skip a loading screen by taking the stairs but taking a elevator somehow forces me into a loading screen. It's almost like Bethesda doesn't know how to animate an elevator.,Negative
Terrible game. Graphics are OK but the game play is horrendous. The worst movement I've encountered. Skip it. Not worth your time.,Negative
"so basically people are pissed because they can't play this game like Skyrim. well go back to playing skyrim then. I personally like this NEW IP and I don't mind most of the criticism. it's a still a Bethesda RPG, this time around it happens to be set in space. it's not a perfect game, I already modded my game heavily to make things better like all past Bethesda games but to me that's the fun of Bethesda games, make it your own. it's why I have a lifetime membership at Nexus mods. so those of you that hate this game I'm sure Bethesda will have another Skyrim remake for you to enjoy but for me I'm going back into this new IP to see what else I got to discover",Positive

"One of the most unenjoyable games I've played. Graphics are amazing, story is pretty great, but the combat is the real let down.It's extremely annoying just how many arrows it takes to kill a simple npc enemy. Making you purposely avoid combat.I thought this was just because my bow was lower level, so I waited and upgraded it, just for the combat to remain the same.The combat ruins this game. If you enjoy mindlessly shooting at something for minutes on end, the game is otherwise great.",Negative
"The best strategy game series so far, blending historical accuracy and clear logic in a grand production. For me, Spending over 1000 hours, reaching Diety within 250 turns in Rome, is satisfying. Personally, not a fan of the art style in 6 or the overly randomised game-play in its DLCs. Hoping that after changing the lead designer, 7 can bring back some classic elements from 5.",Positive

Don't get me wrong, the game's stunning, the gameplay is okayish, the story was looking interesting... but I was only getting frustrated over a combat system that was ruining my experience.

Even if you avoid interacting with them they will STILL randomly become unhappy with you.Fatigue kicks in with minimal training and game time meaning you need to send your players on holiday 3 times a season. This of course also means they aren't developing because you can't train them.Incorrect data.Poor scouting.DoF trying to sign players you can't play due to work permits.They've tried to cover it with some flashy graphics - analysis, cup draws, deadline day etc but it's all style and no substance.",Negative

"Firstly i am enjoying the game,Great Cities and decent side quests. The ship building is cool and having a silent protagonist is so good again.the negative side is the exploration is so boring and bad just a lot of empty places to walk around. Bethesda style games with a one map option like a Morrowind,Skyrim,Fallout 3 and also fallout new vegas are so much more fun to explore. And the games tone in characters is so safe and campy. No crazy mature themes or edgy all the characters seem very soft or written by kids even the crimson fleet. This game makes me miss old fallout mature and cool edgy quests written for mature audience.",Negative

"It's an overall enjoyable experience when it comes to combat and UI. If this were not fallout, the game would be amazing. But it doesn't have the same feel as the others.

"Basically there are 2 phases in the core gameplay loop - the fish catching phase and the restaurant phase where you cook and sell the fish.15 hours in I couldn't find a point where the restaurant phase becomes fun, the only engaging part of the phase is actually the drink minigames which can also be done by NPCs automatically, this phase may as well have a SKIP button. The only challenging part is where you sort the fish by price and add just enough fish to the menu for the night.The biggest problem with the fishing phase is the content bloat. There are so many different types of fish depending on the time of day and the depth, however most of them don't serve an apparent purpose, catching low value fish is almost always worse than catching bigger and expensive fish. The fish within the same price range don't have a unique identity, basically catch whatever fish is the most expensive and available, no reason to have variety in the menu, the customers gobble up whatever you're selling.Very often while playing I'm asking myself ""Why am I even doing this?"". I'm catching fish to sell at the restaurant but it doesn't matter what fish I catch as long as it's the most expensive fish, and I'm selling my fish at the restaurant so I can make money to afford the upgrades I need to catch even more expensive fish and to also automate the core gameplay loop. The answer is the story - it is pretty good and the characters are very interesting and unique, so I just catch enough fish to afford upgrades just enough to comfortably progress the story.Overall, this game looks good from the outside but it has a flawed design and the devs are just adding more bloat instead of addressing the issue. Not the first game to cover up its flaws with more content so it's not that big of a deal but still can't recommend this, wait for a big sale to try it out.",Negative

Game on sale.. looking at the recent reviews... sounds like a good time to pick it up.This game, out of the gate, crashed, then I started playing it and the story is from the get go just so predictable, and linear with zero choice... it was horrendous.  Some people will put up with anything, and have low standards, and will allow this publisher to get away with crap... apparently due to love for their past projects.  I just can't do it.

"This is an complete and utter joke. Even when I first purchased the game is took about 3-4 start up attempts until it actually stayed open and didn't just close after reaching the main menu. Now however the game is literally unplayable. Instantly closes upon main menu. Every. Single. Time. I have spent the better part of 2 days wasting my time trying to look for a fix but there isn't one. I have reinstalled the game several times, reinstalled windows and everything else that could possibly be done. I have had some poor experiences with games not working before this one takes the cake. There is no reason at all for this to happen other than EA being a terrible company that doesn't address and fix these issues. My PC far surpasses all the recommended requirements with ease. The most annoying thing is when the game was working I was actually really enjoying it so my disappointment is now two-fold. Never been a fan of EA as an organisation however I think I now have genuine hatred for them. To charge the amount they charge for a game that literally doesn't even work for thousands of people and do nothing about it is absolutely disgusting. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS UTTER GARBAGE.",Negative

"Not fun at all.The game does a terrible job explaining basic mechanics. Even those shouting ""that is a part of the journey, git gud, this is how the game is supposed to be played"" should be able to admit that the game forces you to look up guides online. Oh, the amount of randomness is overwhelming. No matter how well you party comp is, the monsters just might randomly focus a single character and kill it with 4 crits in a row.The game might be fun for masochists though.",Negative

"I mean it's a fun game. Scratches the AC itch, fun setting, powerful feeling progression, all the usuals.But this port seems kind of hasty. There aren't even achievements integrated into Steam, for example. So for that reason, just play a different AC game. One that's on sale. It scratches the same itch and was probably done with more care.It feels pretty grindy as well, and crashes quite a bit.But on the other hand, you get to be a freakin' viking, and that's really cool.",Negative

It's an excellent game, and when I'm playing, I feel like I lose track of time and could stay immersed for hours. For me, it was an outstanding experience. I highly recommend it.",Positive
"Spectacular music and art direction. Voice over is good, save a few grating voices, and the story is passably interesting. Some very interesting gameplay mechanics as well, but it's all dragged down by one of the most tedious gameplay loops I've seen for such a promising game. Kudos to those patient enough to tough it out. I for one could not, despite my experience in the genre.",Negative

"This game is a disappointment when it comes to other Bullet Hell games. For starters there is no key bind for manual or auto attack, left and right mouse button does the same thing, and there is no option to individually move and attack. Who's idea was it to have attack and movement combined? Your mouse is literally useless in this game, it does not matter where you aim it because the direction your character is facing determines the direction of the attack.Why would I want to attack and move at the same time? What if I want to move right but attack up? Can't do that, can only move up and attack up, move right and attack right.For a game released in 2022, it feels like it was released 10 years ago with the junky controls. Id rather play any other bullet hell game such as Halls of Torment.Maybe you can get this game on sale, but I would still not play this and play other Bullet Hell genre games.",Negative
This game may be old but its one of my childhood favorites so i do suggest playing,Positive
slowly paced and painfully repetitive. fun in the same way endlessly scrolling social media is fun,Negative
"The game keeps crashing and has so many glitches and flaws. It feels like the game has been rushed out without any final checks. Its as though the devs have just been like ""release it anyway as people will buy it!"" Developers, take note and fix it!!",Negative

"As much fun as I have playing this game the lack of optimization this game has cannot be overlooked. I just lost 4 hours of progress because the game crashed. The frame rate drops a considerable amount every time you manipulate the camera in anyway. The game looks good but feels rushed and incomplete. I feel like now I have to save every 10 minuets to ensure I do not lose any progress. Wish I did that earlier because I now have to rebuild my entire city expansion from housing, resources, even to highway infrastructure. In the future when there has been several updates to deal with these issues I would recommend the game, as for now I can't. Buyer beware and now onto taking a long break to deal with the frustration of losing all of my progress.",Negative
"I really want to like this game, but but I really don't... The combat mechanics feel heavy and clunky, the perfect guard is tedious, the dodge is short and slow, and the animations of those actions can't be interrupted. It all makes for a slow and fustrating gameplay that feels poor, inadequate and dated. All other aspects of the game are great, from the OST to the level design. Too bad.",Negative

"Its a boring game for people with a boring imagination.  It does what it does at a top tier, bedazzling the slack-jaw.  When I talk to gamer friends at work, no one has actual memories of the game.  Shallow, but hey, you can see the pores of your party.  Have fun racking up hours of duh.",Negative
Worst game ever..,Negative
"game won't launch more than half the time. you can literally tell when the com is letting you score or about to score on you and there's nothing you can do about it. terrible game so far unless there's something done about it along with many other problems. last great football game was fifa 17, others have been mediocre but this one has been the worst.",Negative
"Really fun game. I've never played a Civilization game before and I can say I'm really enjoying it. I did find it kind of difficult to start out thought. They seem to be under the impression that the only people playing the game, are people that have played the previous ones. The tutorials weren't extremely useful and left a lot to desire. I'm sure the more I play it, I will start to understand the little idiosyncrasies.",Positive
"Product refundedOverhyped trash, runs at 40 fps on a rtx 4080, there is no voice overs just random sounds for dialogue, clunky.",Negative
"fun game. it works on steam deck no issues yet. first launch had to be done in desktop mode, and then i was able to launch from gaming mode.",Positive
"Another year of false advertising. Where is bestter lighting during game, better AI squad building, licenced J league, AI transfer improvements. But numbers are good for SI, so they will keep doing what they have been doing in the past few years",Negative
I love this game so fun to complete worth all the money. Hope i helped you with the decision of your next purchase!,Positive

"Product received for freeSo far I'm quite enjoying myself, the storyline is solid and the music is really quite lovely.There are some minor mechanical issues but they don't hinder the game at all really.

Yeah it's pretty good,Positive
"The second or third dungeon I did the game just threw a monster at my party that kept summoning minions, I couldn't kill the summoner and the minions were way too beefy to get rid of before more were summoned. On top of that, I couldn't retreat from combat for many turns in a row and when it finally did succeed, the monster just reattacked me the next round so I just sat there watching my party get slaughtered.Your mileage may vary, but that's not a concept I associate with a fun experience. Especially not when the training wheels are still on.",Negative
Not worth buying. Game is fun and great gameplay but since it came out it has a problem with constant crashes. They never fixed it and your not able to properly play it. Big no,Negative

awesome,Positive
"I quit playing this game at 60 hrs because it grew old.The fact that you cannot make your authority respected onboard of your ship is displeasant to say the least. The lack of choice in your different answers makes this game very frustrating.For example, I was interrogating patients in an hospital to find someone and I figured out another one of them was also a criminal. There was no option for me to not snitch that person in exchange for nothing at all, so I was forced to accept credits and then the silly girl following me got complaining at me again about how bad I am.Since this game I think I loss the interest in gaming in general...I still have to recommend it because it is good entertainment and already better than most games in many ways.",Positive
"Buy this if you need to be punished.Narration and art are excellent, but the gameplay is frustrating. You can put in a lot of hours and still achieve almost nothing.",Negative
Skyrim meets Privateer? Yes please! I never expected a studio as big as Bethesda to ever write a AAA title designed specifically for me but I'll take it!,Positive
good game but bad aim,Positive
really cool start as you go on,Positive
"Lies of P is very satisfying to play on a moment-to-moment basis and offers an addictive sense of progression in your personal skills as well as the story. It brings very few new ideas to the table but what it borrows from other works it executes wonderfully.One of my main critiques is that there are a lot of two-phase boss fights where if you die in the second phase you have to redo the first before you can try again. This gets exceedingly tedious, particularly in the penultimate fight of the game, which gets boring after the first couple of times you beat it since all of the boss's attacks are very samey and drawn out, and its health pool is predictably bloated.Lowering the required number of parries for the boss's weapon to break, then concluding the phase after the player manages to meet that requirement could rectify this issue. To be clear, the boss's weapon shouldn't remain broken in the following phase.",Positive
"Early Access ReviewVery good game! More like a social platform, I'm kinda tired of kids, eboys, too sexual girls, or people staring all the time on mirrors, or creeps and few others but yeaaaaaaa. It's okay if you find a right people",Positive
A lot of the original issues are fixed. Very much enjoying this one!,Positive

"This game is so much better than FM23.Totaly, recommended.",Positive
I made it to chapter 4 and had to uninstall. The game constantly has a scripting bug where you character can't interact with anything. Only choice is to alt F4 as none of the menus or anything work either. Every time it happens I lose about 20 mins on my save and have to replay through content I've already done.The story is really good. If you can tolerate your play through probably taking 2x longer than a standard play through due to bugs then by all means buy it.i9 13900kRTX 409032GB DDR5 6000mhz2TB 990 PRO nvme,Negative

"Horizon Zero Dawn never truly got to me, like many similiar games do. Sadly, because the world is unique and offers a lot of missed opportunities.The gameplay is basic and every machine fights the same. Hit the weak spots, while dodging. There is no climbing on them or special ways to kill them. It gets boring with time.On the positive side I enjoyed the story. Nothing new or that makes you go wow, but it kept me going to find out what happened. Although I just had one crash and some minor bugs.Overall I can't recommend the game. Graphics are truly beautiful, but neither the story nor the gameplay feels worth it.",Negative
"Game is actually unplayable currently, constant disconnects and black screens. Decided to give the game another chance. Not worth it.",Negative
