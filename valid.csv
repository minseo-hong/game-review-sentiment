No,Negative
Beautiful!,Positive
"Not very fun, you get to play the same 5 dungeons and you cant use the same characters in at most 3 of the same dungeons without having to bring a new low level character on your team. But if you like to grind and don'd mind restarting a lot its a good game, great art style.",Negative
very good,Positive
"Great game. Controller is not properly supported on steam deck. None of the buttons do what they say they do, and it's all jumbled up. Other than the thumbsticks every single steam deck controller button doesn't line up. The game tells me that LB is Zoom, but X is actually Zoom, the same is true for EVERY other button. Good to know that Valve's Steam Deck Compatibility ratings are complete and utter garbage.",Negative

"Product received for freeGOD this game was BORING and super hard to figure out!The person who gave me this game gave it to me because I like history, but as someone who likes history this just wasn't a very enjoyable experience....",Negative

"Even if the game already has a decent amount of contents that are worth the price, in my opinion the potential of NC setting, storytelling is not fully realized yet. You can feel many contents are cut out in an unnatural way. Moreover the gameplay can be further polished.I hope they get the money they want to do better at their next game, take their time to achieve something like Rockstar's games.",Positive
"Game keeps breaking every once in a while, then it's unplayable. Otherwise I like it.",Negative
A SOULS GAME IN 2023 WITH NO MULTIPLAYER. BIG L.,Negative
"Bruh Fallout 4, just the base game itself, was glitchy and laggy on its own. Them porting that laggy and buggy mess into multiplayer just amplified the issues of the base game.I can see why people like it, but I low key feel like they do so purely because they are trying to recreate the feelings they first got while playing FO4.With 76, I doubt I could get paid enough to play through it, let alone do it of my own volition",Negative
"ACT 3 NOT PLAYABLE BECAUSE OF CRAZY LAG AND DELAY, FIX THAT CRAP",Negative
"Heard so much about this game but felt severely underwhelmed, game play feels floaty and the voice acting feels flat,m can't really recommend based on my experience so far",Negative

Game stinks. I'm a barbarian and I wanna fight enemies hack and slash you know good fun stuff instead every enemy is out of reach. Some enemies like the stupid spider Teleports all around the map.  So I'm sitting there with a barbarian trying to kill an enemy while I hit them with my crossbow for two points.. Game stinks can I just fight an enemy and not Just chase them around the map,Negative
pretty nice,Positive
Early Access ReviewYeah.,Positive
"Probably the best money I have ever spent on a game. Maxed all the things and kept my attention long enough to complete all the achievements, I have never done that with another game, so that says a lot.",Positive

"This might be better than MH but then again, it's a new game for me. I usually play other games beside other games but this time, this is all I play for the past few days since Dec 2 when I bought it!I badly need a new GPU. I mean it's already a great game despite of the awful awful graphics",Positive
Product received for freeNot what I wanted from Diablo game tbh.,Negative
Its great! I though my computer would not handel it but it does and i am getting 35 fps and the graphics are on medium to high,Positive
Game still crashes and will never get fixed,Negative
"disappointing. story is boring, there is nothing interesting in the open world, the combat is terrible, too much useless dialogue  which you can't exit until it's finished, can't talk to most npcs, stealth is useless and all movement feels super heavy for an assassin gameonly positive i can find about the game is the world looks good",Negative
Overwhelmingly positive. Definitely makes you play whole day. I have been played for more than 10 hours and still looking to play more.,Positive
good,Positive
Uhhh pretty cool I guess,Positive
it's an annoying game to play. you have to play in a specific way to win. defeats the whole purpose of the game,Negative
Best game of all time,Positive
"It's so buggy it's literally unplayable.I've tried to play this game numerous times, but I just can't. After the recent update, I decided I'd give it another try, but I can't get beyond the starting beach. Saves didn't work, and I kept crashing. I tried reinstalling the game, and after multiple crashes during character creation, I was able to start a new game. Saving still didn't work, and it eventually crashed so hard that my computer restarted. This game is a mess. If anyone has a solution to creating a character, saving, or exploring the starting beach all not working, I'd love to hear it.",Negative
just what you would expect if you played any of the fm games in the past few years. overall pretty balanced and not too many bugs even at release this time.,Positive
Could not even get past the tutorial without it restarting me at the hacking practice part. It would restart me before i even got shot at.,Negative

Early Access ReviewGreat way to learn blender,Positive
Fun,Positive
"Such a shame that when you have a powerful rig to experience the full visual glory of the game, only to be shut down by gnarly crashes with abysmal amount of it. Probably a better experience on console than PC.It is hard to enjoy playing longer than an hour or two. I love The Division, but the sequel isn't doing it for me.",Negative
wtf is this garbanzo game lmao,Negative
fun,Positive
More childish than i would like,Negative
"Easy to play, difficult to master. Very addictive. Infinitely replayable with a lot more depth than meets the eye. Like twin stick, but one stick.",Positive
It's a Civilization game.,Positive
"Gave FO76 a try again during the double XP weekend. The game is really fun! Once I got past level 50 everything opens up and gets really addicting especially making builds and trying to get legendary weapons and armor. Story quests are okay. It feels like FO4 running around doing NPC's errands.The community is wonderful though and I think it's why I really stuck around this time. When I was really low level, a lot of high level players just drop tons of stimpacks, water, plans, weapons, and radaway to help me on my journey. They also helped me during public events with tagging and reviving me with Stimpacks. Everyone is really wholesome. Game feels like the usual modern Fallout games, only to run into a player every so often. Nothing really happens and people just wave at you and go on their way.Camp building gets goofy though. It's a bit buggy but I googled some workarounds and tips to make my camp stuff. If you liked Fallout 4 settlements, FO76 has a similar system.The game is decently generous with atoms now too. The dailies and weeklies aren't too challenging and you get a lot of free stuff from the scoreboard every season.I encourage people to give it a try, especially if they stopped playing around launch time. Do try to get it on sale, as the game gets heavily discounted at that time.",Positive
Unplayable due to constant crashing. I played the demo and didn't realize until after I purchased it how bad it is. Now Steam refuses a refund for a game that does not fully work.,Negative

"Very fun to play with friends, better in a group then a duo.",Positive
"Why would a game update change my game settings? Seriously, why would it stop autosaving and crash after an update?It is a actually good game and does not require as much resource as I was afraid of initially. Yet, too many developer changes and small bugs. A bit uncooked.",Negative
"Bought at launch, was holding off on putting a review until the devs had enough patches and time to work on things, but it's clear nothing will change so here we go.Blatant false advertisement, half of the features advertised aren't even in it, basic core gameplay elements aren't even stable, you've had the first game for what 7 years and this is somehow difficult to make? I've put hundreds of hours into the first one but I'm probably not even going to bother with extending the 25.7 hours on this. Features are watered down, slowed down, made too complex, and are half-way implemented, performance is so laggy even on ssd with low settings, It's fun for the first 20 hours but the cracks start showing really bad and it's just not fun to play. The devs have admitted in a post that this current state of the game meets their goals. So I'm done.Have fun to those who still play and will pay for the 15 DLCs that will come out.",Negative
Amazing how they turned a great game into this stutter fest garbage,Negative
very good game yes,Positive

Its finally good. Has that old Fallout flavor.  It just needed some time to find itself.,Positive

"highly replayable, fantastic story line, defiantly a Bethesda game complete with a few broken quests but community patches fix this.",Positive
A profoundly boring open-world RPG with a story and characters I don't care about and one of the weakest cyberpunk aesthetics I've seen. Also the obsession this game has with Japan is embarrassing.,Negative

the rules and premise are great the game play is eh i find the ai to be stupid they just run into lava when they have a completely clear path. after patch 5 my game has crashed repetitively and before that patch i couldnt even play act 3. fix your game,Negative
WORST GAME I EVER BOUGHT AND ITS NOT EVEN CLOSE.DON'T EVER BUY THIS GAME.Career mode is unplayable unless you pay an extra of around 30 USD and thats just to make your player not utterly terrible.I played quite a lot bad games and it never felt remotely close to how bad I felt when playing this game.DON'T BUY IT,Negative

"steamdeck performance and general feel surprised me. Made me value console friendly design decisions I originally was not a fan of.Game overall in very good state if you are happy with good 50hs of fun a season. Probably more if you are into uber gear chase, I mostly only play until having my buid function and completing some boss milestone.",Positive

This game looks bad. Way worse than the first one! Moving the camera around is not smooth and the buildings are doing some aliasing that makes me feel I am playing a 20 year old game. Wait for a few patches.,Negative
Well Game,Positive
awesome game,Positive
"Way to buggy and the controllers is the biggest joke I ever seen. Its like they brainstormed how to make it as unplayable as possible.Like, slow down your horse on 'left-ctrl' otherwise your horse just run amok into a wall? Really? That was your decision?",Negative
"Really hate that the game manipulate the setting of gaming keyboard lighting, and despite making changes in the setting, every time entering the game, the lighting on keyboard get messed up. Extremely inconsiderate to user experience",Negative
"Still terrible. Came back after a couple of years to confirm what I remembered. Civ 4 is the last decent Sid Meier game. 5 and 6 both look like they were drawn by precocious 7 year old kids. Even on the largest maps, the world feels small. Heck, Civ 4 max zoom out gave you the entire globe.The only upside is it's not an UBISOFT game, even if 2k did copy them by adding a launcher.",Negative
"This game attempts to be difficult without making the difficulty fun or rewarding. Unlike other soulslike games, this game just feels like a complete slog to get through. Most of the difficulty is built upon bosses having large healthpools or having unintuitive move set timing. Effectively this game just forces you to memorize timings and then execute them correctly for 5 to 10 minutes straight. Memorization was not fun in school, and it is not fun in a game.",Negative
I guess you need to NBA2K 2024 to next gen just like in PS5 and XBox console for the best gaming experience. Thank you!,Positive

"Aloy is annoying, and half the loot is worthless. The economy simply makes no sense, and it'd be fine if that was intentional, but money is so plentiful, and used for so little, it becomes meaningless. Plus, most of your inventory is filled with items that are either only useful for trading, or have no value, ensuring the entire looting mechanic is completely worthless.Everything else is alright though, game is just a little too annoying for me to recommend.",Negative

"Big old fan of the battlefield franchise, all the way back from the first game. Now with 2042, 2 years after the release, is when I could give it a chance to BF2042. It was the worst release ever.Only now you can play it right, but I warn you, you can join in, but I recommend to come without too much expectations, because you will not find too many improvements. To me it looks like a mix between BF3 and 4. Actually the more I play BF2042, the more I want to go back to those games.",Positive

"I wanted to love this game so much, but the combat feels so disjointed. The biggest things I look for are fairness and how the enemy tracks you. The latter was what made me hate this game. The enemy tracking is so brutal and unforgiving that I just can't recommend it.",Negative
One of my favorite games ever.,Positive
I want to set the world on fire,Positive
it has a great community,Positive
"I like this game because I like Bethesda's game style. As fallout 76 is a bad online game, Starfield is like a substitution. This game is no bad but it just like a tasteless fallout game in space. There is almost nothing special in this game except ship building. The is nothing like V.A.T.S. from fallout which is unique or new.The main story line make you stop building a permanent base UNTIL you spend a huge amount of time literally repeating the game, if you want to max you level. THIS stop me playing this game when I found out. In fallout 4 they introduce base building and people build creative stuff and player could spend a huge amount of time having fun. Now it is like you need to spend a huge amount of time to have fun. WHY? I don't understand why they would HINDERING one of the selling point of Bethesda's game featuring.I hope they would create a DLC which bring more unique feature to this game. This game need an overhaul.",Negative
"I only bought this game right after Thanksgiving and I've basically been playing it nonstop since. It's one of the best games I have played recently. I typically like games where there is a lot of exploring, crafting, and management, and this game scratches all those itches while still being super casual which I like. Dying is not a disaster. Missions can be failed and tried again at no cost to the player. It's just an all-around great experience. Great job devs!",Positive
"Lightweight game I purchased to play on deck. At first I didn't really think I was going to care for it, as it sort of blends the tutorial and the story and is constantly ADHD-ing all over the place teaching you new mechanics.At the end of the day though, I found it to be relaxing and very enjoyable. The list of things I don't like is far outweighed by the time I've spent exploring the ocean and diving too greedily and too deep.Well worth the investment. Solid game.",Positive
please do not play this game for your own sake,Negative
I like the game. Its one of the best games that I've played in the last years. Still I refuse to give a proper review since I am just annoyed by the game starting updates whenever it wants even though I've set steam to not do updates without my permission. Furthermore the update process on this game works just very poorly. So from a technical aspect this game is a total no-go!,Negative

nice game,Positive
A game which is very replayable,Positive
The writing is still solid but the puzzles have not aged well. Because of the aesthetic of the ruined building the difficulty with many of the later puzzles is just finding the parts of the map that you can interact with.,Negative
"The only thing i really liked is the art and that's it. The game design and mechanics is too clunky, almost impossible to parry attacks because they happen in 2 frames in 240 fps game. The story and ending was also disappointing. Idk why people compare this to soul games, it's almost impossible to get the same satisfaction from fights. I had NO satisfaction when defeating bosses, NONE. The game is hard but not in a way you expect, you just randomly lose hp because of stupid surroundings or mobs that are just hiding behind the wall and do a jump scare.",Negative

Im sure the support is very busy, but it is still a bummer.After all I dont see this as a big issue because if this bug occurs to you too, you can simply refund the game. But i still hope the bug will be resolved.",Negative

"as much as i'd like to recommend it, i cant. I've experienced more bugs in 4 hours playtime than any other game i've played. invisible weapons, game freezing and crashing are the main ones. then you have the gameplay. while it can be very fun, its not great. youve got campers insta killing you upon spawning because for SOME REASON there is no invincibility period after you spawn. Most infantry anti vehicle weapons are literally useless against planes, especially that one specialists rocket cause it moves slower than the HELICOPTERS. to be honest theyre even bad against ground vehicles too, cause you will ALWAYS need more than one rocket to take down a tank, which by then you'll be dead from either the same tank or a guy on foot. Theres also the issue of basically every weapon being useless except assault rifles, but that may just be a skill issue on my end. This game could've been great, but alas it isnt. If EA and dice could somehow balance infantry combat, fix the bugs and ADD AN INVINCIBILITY PERIOD, it would be at least 5x better. In its current state i just cannot recommend this, even if it can be fun.",Negative

I've loved this game since launch. Don't play as often these days but its still fun to dip into. I reached level 600-something and have done pretty much everything and have an op build.

"I've enjoyed the past Fallout Games.  Each one has it's own feel to it.  If you play normally, it honestly does feel like exploring the wasteland.  If you pay the subscription, you can go from super hard to casual mode.  It gives you the chance to build your camp.  Explore the game.. Then in a flick of a switch you can have a very challenging exploration.  I don't know why people complain about subscription.  You never have to see those people.  You have a choice of public servers or your own server with friends without worrying if someone is farming your quest areas.  Some days I dont want to go full hardcore and dodging bullets and juggling resources.  Sometimes I want to just build my camp like giant lego blocks and enjoy the scenery.  Don't let people tell you how to play your game.  It's your money.",Positive

"If there's two npc's talking and your character is between them, and each time one of them talks, your character turns to them without moving his legs, like he is attached to a lazy susan..  is it nit picking to say thats immersion breaking?  is it a fun quark?  is it devs being lazy?no animation for emerging from a dungeon entrance,   just wait a few seconds and your character appears. wheres the payoff?    if forest animals are going to run around the map clipping thru your character without any awareness or substance dont bother.set it to the hardest unlocked difficulty and bosses and hordes still drop potions mid fight?   ..so click click click , watch health bar, press button to refill when low. occasionally do special move, maybe press dodge to feel something.I could say a few good things about it, and there's lots more nit picking I could do, overall just seems to be a glorified mobile game.  a dopamine hit fever dream.",Negative

"Dave the Diver"" delivers a captivating gaming experience where relaxation meets underwater exploration. Set near a picturesque seaside restaurant, the game impresses with its breathtaking ocean exploration and the integration of underwater challenges. The game's strength lies in the idea of exploring the ocean beyond familiar shores, bringing a sense of tranquility and beauty. Players face unexpected underwater challenges, keeping them engaged and providing a sense of accomplishment. The integration of fantastical elements, such as mermaids and their underwater village, adds a charming touch. Exceptional animations contribute to creating a remarkable visual atmosphere. The well-thought-out gameplay offers a unique experience, with intuitive controls and subtle challenges. In concluzion, TRY THE GAME!!!!!!",Positive

"it works okay, game was not finished at release and still is not. the game works okay until your city gets to a certain size. My city is around 300k and the games runs very poorly now. the traffic doesnt really move well at all anymore and i dont mean on high traffic roads, i mean everywhere... you do something and all the traffic instantly stops and takes a while to start moving again. adjusting the game speed no longer makes any difference. one thing ive noticed is there seems to be nothing you can do to get people to go to high school or college or university... very low numbers no matter what.. probably a bug. elementary school seems to be fine.. also im not entirely sure what it is but cant ever seem to get high or medium density demand, i do have high and medium but i never saw demand go up.",Negative

"If you enjoyed Elder Scrolls and the Fallout series, this game is for you. Not as buggy as reviewers have reported. If you played No Mans Sky, this game is not to be compared, although you will find yourself tempted to. This game is quest and story driven. Gun play is great, combat is very fun, tons to loot, base building, and ship creating is fantastic. Expect some Bethesda bugs, which I personally find hilarious and fun to run into, although they are not often. Also this game is a time sucker - you will easily dump many hours into the game before you even know really what is going on. Bethesda could have also done a better job of explaining how to do certain things, but Google and Reddit will be your best friend when it comes to this. Overall fantastic game so far and I am always looking forward to picking up where I left off.",Positive

"Do I recommend this game? Yes, but...Honestly, I want to love this game, but there are so many little things that annoy me I just can't. I am addicted to it and hate it all at the same time.My biggest frustration is it is absolutely brutal when it comes to being a perfectionist. If I want a 90 degree angle I want a 90 degree angle. Not 90.01 so that as I get further in my city development of city streets the entire grid system goes to hell. It has literally ruined every city that I have tried to build.My other frustration is that there is no undo button. If you are using the landscaping tool and botch it...that's it no way to fix it...just live with it.Yes there are a lot of really good qualities to this game, it is absolutely beautiful and its awesome watching your town turn into a city. The freedom to build is only hindered by its minor consistency issues, but those minor issues have become a big deal to me in the long run. I really hope that they end up adjusting little things like this in the future.",Positive

I must be one of the few people that did not enjoy this game very much.

The soundtrack is certainly worth a listen!  Maybe I will give it another chance some day.,Negative

Avoid this game and save your money for something of real value. This game is lackluster and far too pricey for what it offers.  I enjoyed the Diablo series years ago as they seemed more unique and interesting. But this particular iteration lacks originality and is predictable. The graphics are so so. The single and CoOp play fell short of anything special IMO.,Negative

"If you're looking for a fair, balanced, and competitive game, then you might wanna skip this one and play something better instead.The Anti Cheat is so outdated it feels like the game doesn't even have one. The only players getting banned are actually legit people who play with high sensitivity, meanwhile cheaters roam free in every match, and I'm not talking about people who try to hide their cheats by pretending they're legit, the game is infested with obvious wallers who have zero game sense whatsoever and prefire random corners ONLY if there is someone standing there.The game has good potential, but is pretty un-playable at this stage.",Negative

"Definitely, in my opinion, so far one of the worst Football Managers. I've spent five seasons as a manager, and every time after the winter break, my team falls apart, and there's no way to prevent it. I string together 6-7 defeats and draws, using the same tactics, the same players, everything the same. It's the same story every time. Also, it would be clear to me if I were playing with a weaker team, but I'm playing with the best team, with which I used to convincingly beat opponents. Additionally, playing in the Champions League has built a significant budget for quality players, so I have better players than the entire league, yet this always happens after the winter break.",Negative

"Look, it's not a bad game. But to be fair, it's not a good to great game either.  I would say that it's average and you will get some time out of it before eventually getting bored and moving on. Parts of it are tedious, the story feels disjointed and your choices don't matter as much as they should.  This does not lead to immersion or a memorable experience..... On top of the thousands of loading screen.You want to know what is a great recent RPG?  Baldurs gate 3. The world is alive around you and the freedom you have is incomparable to anything.  I had it in my library while I was playing starfield and thought I will try it out for an hour.......couldn't bring myself to go back to Starfield after that. Bg3, unfortunately, illustrated clearly what was missing in Starfield. And I am a long time fan of Bethesda games like the fallout series.It's just a shame that the full potential of a great idea wasn't realized properly.",Negative

"Put over 90 hours in to my playthrough, and since the last update in November, it crashes guaranteed every time within the first 10 minutes.Very fun game, it's just Space Fallout which is exactly what I was happily expecting, but it's insane that Bethesda can release game after game plagued with crashing problems in this day and age. I can't think of another franchise or game that crashes AT ALL, let alone as regularly as Bethesda's.The game is unplayable as it sits right now with my crashing issues, hopefully they fix that in the next update.",Negative
"The save system on this game combined with Nvidia GeForce makes it an experience that is impossible to enjoy.  I've had to replay most of the game between Geforce kicking me off without saving, the game glitching and characters dying from jumping off ledges where they become unresurectable and you have to go back to the last save. Do not get this game or Nvidia GeForce.  The amount of time GeForce has cost me could pay for a new computer.",Negative
"The game's not ready--they're working on it. I wouldn't buy it right now...just wait to see if they fix a lot of the bugs before or shorty after the console release.If they fix it up, I'll happily change this review for a game I was looking forward to for years.But hey, maybe this simulation just isn't for me--at least that's what Mariina Hallikainen, CEO and co-founder of the Finnish game development studio Colossal Order has told us all.",Negative

"It might improve now I have done the main story quest?The quest which you get near the end of the story called Over designed seems like it might be a self aware parody of how Starfield was made. If you go with the Kitchen sink budget option, and then try to please everyone on the design team you get a technically correct Frankenstein of a ship that on paper is all things for everyone.In reality it is a good way to get your hands on some in-game currency and a foundation to make a new and better ship without grinding for credits.Obstructive mechanisms such as resource gathering and ineffective storage and trade links spoil aspects of the game that might be more fun. I forgot my character had special powers as I never seemed to need them. Once I maxed the skills needed to build a class C ship I didn't need any tactics to win a space battle, and the same was true for my Space suit and weapons and the foot bound combat system.I would have loved to build complex supply chains and outposts across the exported stars but could not seems to make it work as it seemed it should have.Base defence might have been fun if you could build a wall.The woke agenda has also had its effect as well, the game seems to promote things that are socially destructive like drugs and there is no really gritty or mature content other than some lame innuendo.When you blow someone up they should get blown up, some nudity is appropriate without being exploitative if it isn't gratuitous the best stories leave some things to the imagination and provide details to pull you in.Perhaps the game budget could have included alternate animations and in-game assets to cater to players' tastes.I am glad I played Starfield through, and may look at a modded play though when we see some maturity in the overhauls and bug fix mods.I liked the vision but not the execution of Starfield.",Positive

"I really hate to give it a thumbs down and would love to recommend this game, but sadly this recent patch has made it insanely unplayable. Dice rolls feel terrible out of nowhere now? The graphics don't even look good anymore, screen tearing, blurriness, it looks bad since I last played it. I don't know what is going on with this game, also people are saying in Act 3 it get EVEN WORSE than it is in 1 and 2 that is wild lol. Great game that fails at the sake of optimization, and it not being finished.",Negative
"Its missing alot. Leaves much to be desired. Not much detail goes into actually building a city. Theres a very limited number of things you can place aswell. Want to build a custom part? too bad nobody will use it. Want a sport complex other than football, soccer, or a pool? Too bad. Want any other building style besides ""European"" or ""North American""? Too bad. Fishing industry? nope. Detailed infrastructure? Nope, everything is done for you magically through the ""industry zoning"". Also if you make every road pedestrian only, people love it. Despite having to walk hours to get anywhere. No options to provide bikes either. Just public transit. Also may god help you if you have more than a single public transit route overlap with another. You will never see it - they just overlap.",Negative

Product refundedThe games fine but Rockstar has the absolute worst customer service in existence. They're worse than a bunch of handicapped donkeys trying to figure out words. They don't believe I own the steam account I'm currently typing on despite providing them with 4 different types of proof. So fxxx them and their game.,Negative
"It looks like an 8h game being stretched to become a 50h game.At first, the world-building looks promising, you wonder what happened to the world. However even if some questions are answered some don't make any sense and only are there for the sake of the gameplay, even if it's immersion-breaking.The gameplay looks great at the beginning but becomes tedious early on, you only have two hits with your spear, and bow gameplay becomes redundant very quickly.The skill progression is awful only the first row of skills changes the way you fight and are exciting, once you hit level 10 you're done, at level 40 you'll be playing the exact same way.The voice-acting is excellent but is mostly used to listen to people standing there, talking for hours without much happening.The graphics are... gorgeous, nothing negative here.The bottom line is, buy it on sale, play 10 hours at most and uninstall. Which sadly, seems to be the new way of making action-adventure games nowadays.",Negative

"I have never left a review ever, this is indeed my first review after playing on Steam for over 10 years.This game sucks. So many bugs and weird settings.Those bugs are not something insignificant like ugly people or square buildings.They are all CRITICAL BUGS THAT AFFECTS YOUR GAMEPLAY!!Even without the bugs, the game itself has very weird settings and lacks a lot of actual city features.I bet these developers never even lived in a city, They go on a business trip to NYC for 2 weeks and suddenly think they are city expert and ready to develop a city builder. Get out of here.Have an actual urban expert help you with the development!This game seems to me very amateur, unfinished and unprofessional. How disappointing.",Negative

The open world concept and story is nice and looks amazing but it plays like a WoW RPG with the mechanics of a xbox 360 game. The gun FX and explosions are horrible and you cannot even look down the iron sights. Multiplayer might be fun but the overall game play is lacking to much like most Tom Clancy games to make it worth playing. Most will like it only because they dont know any better.,Negative
"this game is a lot more than it seems on first look!first i thought this would be a sidescroller diving game, where you would catch fish for your sushi restaurant, and then serve the catched fish as sushi for guests. but this game is just so much more than that. as you play, it becomes bigger and bigger, and it has quite a richful story, which i didn't expect also. its good for playing for longer sessions, as it is good for playing just in between.i had fun with this one, this is cool!",Positive

"This used to be one of my favorite games - love Cities Skylines 1.  Cities Skylines 2 - has been a buggy mess.  Performance sucks, if you go in potato mode its playable but ugly as sin.  I have a very capable system and its sad to see the game and how bad it is.  The recent update... let me tell you... its neat... Every 5 mins the game is crashing.  Not like a freeze then crash... like literally drawing a road and game crashes.  I have built the same road and the same area 10 times this morning.   In 12 to 24 months.... maybe i could recommend this game... as it stand right now its rough... and thats being nice.  With the say things are going i would say stick with cities skylines 1 for the next 2 years then come back and take a look at this game.  They don't have mod support, map designer, glitches, crashes, performance issues, graphics issues... save the money continue with skylines 1 for the next 24 months.Absolute trash right now... uninstalled after the latest patch they just pushed - it broke the game completely for me.   will check back in 12 months to see where they are and if they made the game better.

"The game is very repetitive. I've had fun with it, but I definitely wouldn't recommend it. Feels like there wasn't much thought put into a lot of the quests - like, why does a 200 year old ship have exactly the same computers and technology as new ships?",Negative
"It'd be an alright game, but it has technical issues that ubisoft has no interest in addressing.  I was able to play it once.  Had it running for about 10 hours, but wasn't actively playing it the whole time.  It crashed at some point and wouldn't restart.  Reinstalled it several times, messed with cache, firewall, internet settings, router, vpn, all to no avail.  Kept getting some error about not being able to connect to servers.  Even though it's a single player game you have to be online to play it. After a some googling for troubleshooting found out this has been a problem for five or six years that still hasn't been addressed.  Can't play it, can't get a refund.  Don't recommend unless the address the problem.",Negative

"This is basically just FM23 which was an awful game itself with some little tweaks like the game modes which aren't really all that special. I wish i could take a team, recruit a certain type of player and play beautiful football but doing that you can see results like Man City losing at home against Luton, Man City haven't lost at home for a year or so. Biggest thing for me is CM position being NULL now, instead having to have two DM's and a bunch of CM's retrained there just to get something working. They say something new and big will come for 25, but the lack of anything this year how could I want to purchase? DO BETTER SI. DO BETTER MILES. YOUR GAME IS AWFUL.",Negative

Fairly boring. I'm not interested in the world or enemies and playing this makes me want to go back and play Fromsoft games.

"This is my first review of a game because it left me with such a feeling that I thought it was warranted.I liked that this game was short - it was a good follow-up to the first game. The combat was fun but repetitive.But man, in my opinion, the characters in this game are a giant snooze-fest. Ganke is just boring, but my biggest issue is with Phin.The fact that Phin consistently kicks your ass the entire game is so laughable and so frustrating. There is nothing that the game does to build up any sort of rapport or backstory with her to make me feel like I should care about her. It's literally one dinner scene and then all of a sudden she's the villain. The writers felt like it would make for a really enjoyable experience for you to lose each encounter with her. You're telling me that just because she has this fancy gear, that makes her a more competent fighter? Give me a break. And then she sacrifices herself at the end? I don't actually get to defeat her? The story would have been great without her in it. It ruined the experience.",Negative

did not enjoy. screen is super busy and incoherent- every aspect of gameplay is either explained poorly or not at all. its totally unclear how attacks and the turn order work. the music is bad and full of annoying flourishes! which actively clash with the game's intended gloomy theme. the constant narration is obnoxious and cheesy.,Negative

"As an avid fan of all city builders, and huge fan of cities skyline 1, I have really loved playing CS2. The game launched with a rocky start but the dev team has been on top of it with frequent patches and fielding feedback from the community. I enjoy the mechanics of this game compared to it's predecessor and look forward to seeing the game improve some more as modding is released, and the dev team addresses more of the minor bugs.People here complain about it being a half-finished game, but I would disagree. Could it have been pushed back a few weeks to deliver a more polished experience? Sure, but if it were my choice, I would've wanted them to release it anyways so I could start playing as soon as possible.",Positive

Early Access Reviewsilly,Positive
"This is gonna be a hard one. I'm about 520 hours into this game and done many playthroughs. The release of this game, and the quality at release was AMAZING. This game absolutely blew me out of the water like literally no game ever has, or ever will again. The story, sheer amount of detail, and character romance stories are unparalleled  by anything that has come before, and the immersion was as well before the last update. The combat was also innovative and incredible. However, due to the damage of the last two updates, I can only recommend that people save their money and not bother for a long while. The last update before today broke the combat and made act 3 virtually unplayable, with the party freezing and you being unable to interact with anything for anyone for anywhere between 5 and 20 minutes, and this would happen every 10 yards if travel, often even less. And mind you this is with a badass PC and no mods. Making choices throughout the game was proven to slow down performance, and that speaks to a much deeper problem with the game's design that must be fixed before it will be worth playing again. Today's update completely destroyed the game. Any attempt to play the game- whether trying to load an old game or start a new one- will result in an immediate crash to desktop. I've tried reinstalling the game and nothing has worked. After how much I grew to love this game over the first 350 hours of gameplay, this is devastating and hurtfull, as well how insulting the last 150 hours felt with the game being broken from the last update. I hope one day the devs will figure out what the hell theyre doing, because I've never seen a game go from amazing to unplayable, only the other way around. Save your money and dont buy this until it's fixed. If they can ever restore the game to its former glory, I'll change my review. But dont waste your time and money on this just yet if you haven't already",Negative

"I wanted to like this game. I hoped it would be a better Elite Dangerous. Something I could sink my teeth into for hours before a satisfying ending. I can't play this game. Even with enough mods to remake this game, I can't enjoy it.The weapons are all various flavors of vanilla, and with the bullet sponge enemies they all feel like you are flinging farts. An unbearable number of missions involve more loading screens than gameplay. The main quest story is what killed this for me.I say this with as little spoilers as possible, but the main plot is just Rick and Morty.They had all of space to work with, alien discoveries, or space plague to use as a plot... and they chose Rick and Morty BS.Fallout 76 at launch was a better game than this will ever be.",Negative

"It's an ok shooter, small servers and doesn't feel at all like a Fallout game since there is very little story or interaction with NPC's. The events are garbage and while your character can level up into the thousands, gear completely stops levelling at 50, and you will hit this cap very quickly and stagnate. The birthday event is bs and Bethesda clearly has no concern for the fanbase trying to enjoy the game. Only slightly less disappointing than their awful ESO.",Negative

"As fun as the core game is, so many of its mechanics are purposely built to make your experience of playing the game as miserable as possible. The movement system is terrible. Throughout. Walking, running, or even riding a horse is painfully clunky at the best of times.The crime system is genuinely horrible. Self-defense is discouraged completely. It's better to allow yourself to be shot down than risk incurring the long arm of the law getting you instead. Trying to do anything even marginally illegal will get the entire county on your behind in spite of no witnesses actually being nearby to see you or carrying a mask over your face.As much as this game is about outlaws and their struggle, it's about making you struggle just as much as them to enjoy the experience. Just get RDR1 or GTA5 if you want to play a RockStar game, because this is genuinely a miserable experience far too often to justify the price tag.",Negative

"Assassin's Creed Valhalla, with its Viking warrior setting, represents a departure from the series' traditional formula. As a fan of previous AC games, I found it didn't quite capture the same magic. While the story and characters remained strong, the game lacked the deep connection to the Assassins vs. Templar conflict. Valhalla feels more like a Viking saga with AC elements, which might not suit fans of the older formula. It's enjoyable for those interested in the Viking era but left me longing for the traditional AC experience.",Negative

The faction missions in particular are the  most fun I've had in a videogame for ages.Doubtless this comment will attract the usual sneering derision from people who are furious that the game has loading screens - despite every other Bethesda title since Morrowind having loading screens, or are furious that the game isn't a pure space exploration game in the style of No Man's Sky - or who just speedran and rushed through content, and then concluded it was 'shallow', or merely siubscribed to the memes and groupthink.But if you are independent-minded and willing to form your own conclusions and enjoy a great space adventure yarn you'll probably like Starfield.",Positive
"Boring enemy design, boring level design, and a story that flushes itself down the toilet in the second half makes Lies of P a pretty soulless and unfun experience. It's well-optimized and some weapons are fun to use but that's about all the praise I can give.",Negative
SO FUN!!!!!!!,Positive
great!,Positive
Quite literally the worst garbage I've ever come across in my 21 years on Earth. I will be surprised if anything that comes at any point later in my life is of worse quality than this game. Nothing works. No fun at all. Definitely would rather sweep the streets riddled with heroin needles and trash than sit home in a comfortable environment and play this game.,Negative

"Product refundedI tried to play this game but it crashed twice at launch.  Went for the refund rather than be stuck with a broken game.It' a shame, because I've played many hours of Cities Skylines.  Guess I'll stick with that one.",Negative
"BGS is a game that focus's on gender and identity politics, under the guise of table top rpg elements with an agenda to slowly move those not infected and in hopes its perverse ideals take root. There are three types of players involved into this, people who are aware and reject its wokness and politics, people who are too naive to know the differences and people who support the mental cancers that this game push's.This is the foundation of the game and those that speak of its qualities falls under those three.With that, I am disappointed in this move but not surprised. Its not the baldur's gate that the real fans wanted, but the one we deserve in a sense cause of our weaknesses to point out the sickness that growing in society, letting it spread.",Negative
This Game is just a DLC to the Spiderman game thats more woke and more broke.,Negative

A classic. More hours put in than I like to admit. Was a fun game and made me realize how much I liked turn based cit builders.,Positive
Absolutely disgustingly difficult combat. Stuck on the first boss makes this zero fun what so ever. Exceedingly disappointed.,Negative

"Always loved the civ series but V killed it for me. Gone are overlapping systems you could dynamically respond to and manipulate as the game goes on. Instead you pick one way to win at the beginning of the game and just dogmatically follow it until the end. The Civs are too different from one another and too locked into certain strategies.Also, I don't care about the tactical battles. I want to be running a civilization, my generals should handle the nitty gritty of combat.",Negative

"This is one of the best games I've ever played. I can't believe how accurately this game simulates our real lives. Build a big city with everything a city needs. It looks very real when you look at the details of the roads, buildings and people. This is a good game if anyone wants to be creative and improve their skills in management, construction, design, thinking, etc.",Positive

"The fundamental gameplay loop of a bethesda game is broken in this game. I can't just walk and walk and keep finding interesting things to do, because there's almost nothing of interest in the whole game.I like subnautica, for example, a game with different gameplay loops that starfield, but even though there is very little intelligent life, there's so much more to do that is rewarding. Why does bethesda still refuse to give us vehicles? there's so much issues in this game of storing resources that you're basically encouraged to not even scavenge resources, because where are you going to put them? Ship is already full, your full, all your companions are full. Can't make a base until late game. Chests barely hold anything. Who made these decisions?Why can't we swim like we could in other bethesda games? Zero gravity has to be kinda similar to swimming, it's just a weird choice.Why are all the companions boring, hate doing interesting things, but also are all trying to date me even though I don't show any interest in them because they are boring? All of these characters are much worse than characters in fallout 4 which had some of my favorite characters in a bethesda game like Cait.Why isn't there a quest involved in the politics of the UC.Why are the pirates just bad guys? A good bad guy should think they are the good guy at least. It seems pretty obvious the UC has done a lot of bad stuff, so it should be pretty easy to write that group as opposed to the UC's bad stuff. Fine, you don't want the pirates to be freedom fighters, well then let me join a faction that is freedom fighters.Why aren't their big dungeons or caves that are interesting? Put a golden claw in somewhere or give me a vault to explore where they did experiments. All the caves are basically empty mining passages where alien bugs took over. That's fine, but it gets repetitive.I don't usually review games, but after I saw that bethesda was responding to these reviews I was hoping some unpaid intern somewhere might at least read this and pass some of these comments back.boring game and ultimately I'm less excited for elder scrolls now and I've been waiting for a third of my life for the next one.",Negative
"Possibly one of the worst games ever made. The devs should be embarrassed to have their names attached to something so bad. This is exactly why its for sale, because nobody wants this junk. Anyone involved in this game should be fired and blacklisted from the industry.",Negative
"Even after being out for 3 years this game is still too buggy to play.  I love the world and the creative team did a great job but the game was really let down by the programming department.  I've run into multiple game ending bugs as well as a plethora of smaller bugs.  It's really frustrating trying to figure out what you're doing wrong in a mission and then after doing research on the internet you find out that the quest has just been bugged from release day and it's still not been fixed.  And that was one of the tutorial missions. ""Luckily"" they let you skip the tutorial but now I'm wishing they hadn't because I would have returned the game at that time and not spent hours slogging through the buggiest release I've ever played.",Negative
Still a fan of civ3 but this one's got it all. ONE MORE TURN. woop woop,Positive
"I love the game play, the quests, the cellar and dungeons, the leveling, star build elements, but i dislike is the disconnecting randomly while in the middle of a boss battle. it has happened numerous times.",Positive
"Great Story,realistic action scenesable to roam freely",Positive
I regret not getting this early.,Positive
"It is crazy that split screen co-op automatically unlocks every level for you, essentially just loading a completed game.Useless.",Negative
"well, there is not words that can explain inside of me, of how much i love this game and how much i have played it, i got it on steam on november this year, but when i first played it. it was in november 2015 on my grandma's pc. and dude. this is my second favorite rpg of all time. unquestionable, well made and made me cry and feel that i finally completed something. ill never do genocide tbh, i never liked to kill them and i never will. pacifist for life. thank you toby fox, for being part of my childhood.",Positive

"Every single online match is just full of hackers. There's 0 point to online play in public. Given this games age one would expect a better suite of moderation and reporting tools, but that definitely is lacking as the rampant cheating never ceases",Negative

"Product likes these are a work in progress, and if anything its kept me addicted for quite a bit of time.Its enjoyable, even if you do question the accuracy of the simulation elements. But as I said above, its a work in progress, and just an enjoyable experience.",Positive
More launchers needed.,Negative
"Starfield is a good game for those who are looking for a fun RPG. I have been a huge fan of the Fallout series in the past and was very excited to play Starfield.Yes this game has some bugs, but what game doesn't have one? I finished the main story line today for the first time and I was amazed by the depth of the story. You can also choose to blaze your own path and do one of the dozens if not hundreds of side quests at any time.I think if you're a fan of past Bethesda games, you will enjoy this one too. Don't let all the negative reviews change your mind. Give it a shot!",Positive

terrible game,Negative
"Fun and repayable for a good few hours, after though this game serves no other purpose than to keep me busy while I'm waiting on something.Shallow and repetitive, dull, no plot. Can't recommend. The games only two mechanics are ""Move"" and ""Choose"" something from a menu.Plenty of much better games out there, the only reason it's popular is it's very cheap.",Negative
Really good spiderman game.,Positive
"The fate of the world is once again on the line, but none of the excitement is there.",Negative
"I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone at this stage of the game. For City builder things do not feel very connect and this new version of this game, seem relay on you exporting resources to make your money, and by make your money i mean all your money. Its not a fun experience micro managing everything, and info that the games resources just seem useless or pointless to have, if doesn't help make game more enjoyable.So at this time don't buy it. you have no freedom to do what in this game.",Negative
Very good game,Positive

"If you enjoy the combat of Souls games and dislike the exploration aspects, this will be a great experience.Game  has  good combat and world design, great atmosphere.The level design is terrible.Most areas have a single correct path to take, with an occasional side room containing  an enemy and chest that gives you a consumable you will never use. You navigate a gorgeous corridor filled with enemies to get to a mini-boss, after killing the mini-boss the doors to the next corridor open automatically. Rinse and repeat.  No interconnected world or even exploration of the separate levels most of the time.Half way trough the game your weapons are powerful enough to 3 hit combo most enemies so you stop engaging with the combat system, outside of bosses, which combines with the simple level design to make parts of the game tedious. I just ran trough chunks of the later levels as I could not be asked to fight copy pasted enemies in a corridor again.",Negative
Story is awesome.Multiplayer too predatory with micro-transactions and full of hackers in free roam to be worth playing.,Negative
its great,Positive
"Needs some more end-game content. Once you've upgraded all of the weapons in around 10 minutes, there's nothing more to do. I stood still for 15 minutes before a grim reaper NPC showed up and thankfully ended the ""gameplay."" I do enjoy the game, I just couldn't recommend it to anyone as the gameplay lasts for about 5 minutes.",Negative
