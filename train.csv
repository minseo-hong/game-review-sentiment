THE SHARK was ALREADY on us and getting down. of course we couldn't do anything because it was QUADRUPLE our size!!!!! DONT RECOMMEND!!!!!!!!!!!,Positive

"Brought this game originally on Ubisoft and brought again after Ubisoft released on Steam for my Steam Deck.Game plays well on both my linux gaming rig and Steam Deck. Had to do minimal tweaking on my gaming rig, and got decent battery life on Steam Deck with the refresh rate locked to 40fps.Story line is good, and the end game does become a tad repetitive but I don't mind that.",Positive

"I have spent many hours on this game as I a huge fan, but this is the first game I have had to turn on, shut down, turn on shut down several times just to play then when i am finally able to play the constant lag and sometimes the game either shuts off then when i turn it back on i have to repeat the whole process again. Oh yeah I play with a controller cause using the keyboard and mouse hurts my hands and that whole turning off process is part of that too. As it stands this will be the last Battlefield game I buy. This game is broke still! No paying customer or fan should have to deal with the many technical issues ever!",Negative
I now understand why people spend hours playing this game. It's fun to play with friends.,Positive

"This game makes me think I don't like 4X games, which I'm pretty sure isn't true. It has some fun ideas, but the best thing about this game is that it inspired other really good 4X games. Hey actually, I had a great idea. Play those.This game is pretty boring in my experience and it doesn't really communicate how to play it very well. I'm sure any of you brilliant people could figure it out but I don't see the point in playing this type of a game when it won't help you try to understand all it's systems. If you like it though I hope you enjoy it, and definitely play with your friends. When I did enjoy it, I was in a phone call with the homies.",Negative

"I bought this on sale, and was shocked to see the amount of glitches in this game. You'll turn down a street and see half-rendered polygons walking around. After a few moments they materialize and then you see every person on the street is the exact same NPC lol. Cars randomly explode in the sky, you turn around and all-of-a-sudden 50 people spawn screaming and running, people make the ""T"" shape and hover around. I thought these were problems with the game on release, not after the most recent patching. That and the loading screens make it hard to play.",Negative
"Addictive game, lots of fun",Positive
"Great game story line is almost perfect and fun. Completed in about 66hr, or less i did a lot of random stuff like online not just the missions back to back. Honestly you could probably knock this game out in 2 or 3 weekends if you wanted to. I don't have any extra stuff just the game the over all game play was great the bots weren't to hard to kill. Police were fairly balanced if you wanted to fight them you could but it was just as easy to hide. But my main complaint would be the ending of the story mode i feel like they could have made it more harder to kill the leaders or at least made killing them each having a separate mission. They Likely could have gotten an extra 20 minutes or so out of it I just feel like with the base game theirs some thing that should have been added. It just feels like you were riled up for a bit finish with 3 big fights and it didn't happen. But I would still play and don't regret buying.",Positive

"The game is still broken for many people. I cannot even launch the game without it crashing. I have not played a single second, and have spent more than a few hours just trying to get it to launch. CDPR is a joke, and their customer support is nonexistent. Maybe its worth a shot if you can play it, but if its crashing at launch, save yourself the time and effort and just get a refund.",Negative

"One of the best Assassin's Creed games in my opinion. However, it should have been called Viking's Creed or something different because you're not an assassin, you're a brutal murderer in this game.This game is so rich with content that it is overwhelming. I didn't think it was possible to make a game too good, but this is what has happened here.The combat is superb in my opinion, although at first, I didn't like it. I couldn't get used to not being able to hold down the right trigger for a built-up power swing, but instead gaining access to skills. I'm used to this now, and I really do enjoy it. The gore and bloody finishing scenes with dismemberment are perfect for me - I just wish there were more of them because they are satisfying.The scenery is very pleasing to the eye. The environments created in this game, combined with the weather is beautiful. Some of snowy areas in this game seem to really capture that cold, dark, frosty look.I will never be able to fully complete this game. It would take a very long time indeed. I always find myself coming back to it now and then to progress a little further. It's a flawed gem I think. Credit to the devs working on this, though. It must have taken a lot of effort.",Positive

"These developers should have their studio burned down. This game is a trashy waste of time. They just took the worst combat feature in any Soulslike, the parry, and made that the main mechanic that combat revolves around.As someone who has never parried ANY enemy is ANY Soulslike because the timing is absolute trash is every game it's featured it, well, it remains true here. All these idiots who say ""jUsT PaRrY BeFoRe yOu GeT hIt"" are too stupid to understand that input lag and slowed reaction time due to age make that IMPOSSIBLE.Hogwarts Legacy has a better, more responsive dodge than ANY Soulslike could ever wish to have.Devs really are too stupid to know how to make games anymore. You're supposed to take the BEST from other games, not the worst. I'm not going to spend hours on ONE boss just to learn how to parry its r e tt a r d e d attacks.",Negative

The devs swear they are trying to fix it, they put out weekly updates saying 140,000 accounts banned this ""week"" with an average playerbase of 400,000. They allow cheaters to make new accounts so they can spend more money on skins. Thats all this game is now, an ATM for the devs.",Negative

"Have to give a negative review because I cant give a middling. The difficulty gets to be frustrating, losing half a health bar after two attacks on the explorer mode is too much. If I choose story I don't want combat.  I should have seen this coming from DOS2. The story and characters seem good so far but I may never know because I am stuck.",Negative
Great game,Positive
"I played 60 hours. I played on the 'easiest' difficulty. I was drawn to this game by the very unique and beautiful art style, fantastic music, and great storytelling. I was aware this game has a reputation for being difficult. I even installed various mods to make it easier because I wanted a casual experience.It wasn't too bad at first, but turns out the game gets 'more difficult' as you progress by turning up the terrible game mechanics to an 11. Enemies start dodging ALL of your attacks, oneshotting or two shotting your entire party with critical hits back to back, the enemy always out speeds you later in the game and always goes first. Traditional elements of strategy you may see in other turn based rpgs becomes less and less important as you progress.It feels absolutely helpless and there's seriously no fun in throwing your highest level heroes at certain dungeons over and over again and having them all die. You spent 15 hours and went through 10 dungeons to level up a fresh party to go after a higher level dungeon? LOL here comes some terrible rng to throw away all of your efforts. Hard games are fun when they feel fair, and you feel rewarded for overcoming the challenge. There's none of that here. Only a smidgen of relief when you finally get lucky and don't get screwed over by unlucky 'randomness'.Final straw for me was losing an entire party of max level heroes, to back to back crits from a basic mob enemy. The basic baddie put my entire team on 'deaths door' in one hit, the turn order reset and he immediately took another turn and proceeded to wipe my party.",Negative

This game was fantastic until Act III and the story.  The story arc in Act III completely ruined the game for me and I couldn't finish because it literally took the fun out of it.

"It's pretty good at first, but overall it's just kinda boring. It doesn't really challenge you in any way except for the boss fights. It gets very repetitive exploring the same areas to reach whatever minor plot point you're at in the story. It's sorta structured like an rpg, but there's barely anything to really work towards that isn't directly tied to the plot. Restaurant management is shallow, exploration is shallow, my desire to play this game anymore is shallow.",Negative

"Game crashes every once in awhile. That isn't that bad on its own, but the game takes so long to tell its story, introduce its characters, and have you run place to place across a vast empty land, that any time it does crash just feels like a fantastic opportunity to put the game down.I have had a lukewarm reception to this game, and it's been... hard to justify playing it when I could get equal entertainment from free youtube videos. It's just not good enough for my standards.",Negative
just because of the first video they have on the store page tbh.,Negative
Economies are flawed. Cargos are teleported. Workers magically appears even without people commuting.

This company is basically stealing. After paying for the hall of fame pass the game will not let anyone play 3v3 or 2v2 matches.

"Product refundedRuns like absolute crap. Not exaggerating.Ugly. Things that shouldn't be plastic look like plastic. Which is the last thing you want in a post-apocalyptic.Pushes ""The Message"". Microtransactions.Soulless. Directionless.Convoluted character creation.Trope of non-interactable objects baked into the map.Yeah I'm making this review because it keeps popping up in my recommended despite me already getting a refund. This god-awful game needs to die. I'd rather play starfield than this, which is saying something.",Negative

"The game is essentially Harvest Moon with some mild tweaks. Featuring very general relationship building, farming, mining, animal care, and more, this game has many levels that will keep one busy. The nature of the game is very grind-heavy though, so be aware.",Positive

"The game was great until the 2.0 patch which completely ruined and re modified the character builds.    I have over 300 hours of game play with my two characters built perfectly.  Then, when patch 2.0 hit, it completely reset them and changed everything about them.  This is a single player game, not an mmo.  Resetting people's characters for no damn reason is not a good way to keep players playing when they have hundreds of hours invested in their character that were built a certain way and learned how to play the game that way for hundred of hours.   I understand patching can be a good thing for bugs, AI, NPC's, environmental etc, but resetting people's character builds is f'ed up.",Negative
Great game,Positive
awful gameplay been buying the games since 2020 this is the worst one,Negative
"DO NOT BUY DIVISION 2 ON STEAM. It has bugs concerning multiplayer mode that are NOT ADVERTISED. The multiplayer mode opens up sometime AFTER steam's 2 hour return policy time deadline, by the time you discover the bug you've played more than 2 hours.",Negative

"LFG for this game is trash, raids are overly complicated for no reason, raid loot has wayyy too low of a drop chance for how difficult the raids can be, loot pool is garbage, only stats that matter are red stats its like armor doesnt even exist and if your in a group i pray for your armor, this is honestly a super disappointing game for how much i used to like it. Division 1 isnt even this bad and i barely liked that game dont waste your money on this trash, buy a different game.",Negative
gg,Positive
Don't know why or what happened but unable to play the game as it won't launch,Negative
"Literally cannot be played.""Out of memory"" crash almost every time when I launch the game. Rockstar says""Setting windows to automatically manage virtual memory may resolve the cause of these crashes.""It does not solve the problem. Cannot find a solution, this is annoying and ridiculous for a nearly 5 years old game.And if it wasn't enough, there's the Rockstar Launcher, full of Chinese and Russian hackers who stole Rockstar accounts, read about it on different forums. For example, I received a Chinese email about password reset.Anyway, I will try to refund for my mental health.",Negative
"The game is truly impressive. The terrain tool stands out with its excellence, and I am particularly enamored by the captivating visuals of the game. However, it's worth noting that there are some performance issues and occasional crashes. I'm eagerly anticipating the addition of mods, which I believe will enhance the overall gaming experience.",Positive
"Quests are boring. The main story isn't that interesting. Man, I feel like this game is huge, but with very little to offer. I feel like it's missing that magic that Skyrim has.",Negative
Definitely alot better than 2 years ago,Positive
Uroboro's eye goes brrrr,Positive
Brings new meaning to the words RPG,Positive
"The game is really addicting at first when you collect all the cool characters and see all the cool maps. It almost feels exploitive how it really activates your dopamine. Unfortunately, after you collect most of the stuff, the game feels like the biggest waste of time to play imaginable. It just stops being fun and the game wants you to play for too long to unlock the remaining things.The soundtrack is amazing though, so I'd honestly would rather recommend you to only buy the soundtrack at most.",Negative

"Game is riddled with bugs and weird dialog issues where you are accused of doing things you haven't, or get locked into consequences for things you did or didn't do, depending on which side of the circumstance you are on. Game has been out for a long while now and in true Ubisoft fashion, they have stopped fixing these issues. Save yourself some time, watch a playthrough on YouTube or something. The game isn't worth the money or the grind.",Negative

"At first, I bought the game not realizing that it was just the beta. Once I got the full version, despite game stats indicating that it should run on my Mac it runs slow and choppy  and I have had to reinstall after the most recent patch-- it is unbearably slow to load and run-- I was so excited about this game but it is not worth running on a MAC",Negative

"Lots of computer performance questions - particularly important as your city grows larger. However, if you have the horsepower, this is a truly remarkable game. There are many improvements over the first major version, which lasted nearly 10 years and had tons of DLC love, so a large community exists already. I'm most impressed by the simulation algorithm, which has moved forward in significant ways. People have their entire lives charted and take actions that are commensurate - going to work, going shopping, going to schools in the area, etc. There are certainly many little bugs and behavioral patterns to work out, but I'm confident the Colossal Order team is committed to perfecting this beast. It's enormously fun, and a big step forward in city sim builders.",Positive
"I pre-purchased this and only have 37 hours of game play. Its just not fun, give it some time so we can have mods and all that before you purchase or wait for a sale. It's not worth the money in its current state, youre better off getting CS1 and waiting a few years for this one to catch up.",Negative
greatest game ive ever beaten,Positive
"Can't play this anymore. It crashes, then won't re-load. So I can never finish even half a game. Aspyr seems to have abandoned Mac support. I loved this game. Played it for years. But now, I can't. It sucks. Better than Civ 6 though, which doesn't run at all.",Negative

"Got the game on steam and it is crashing my entire pc every 1-2 games, i cannot enjoy this game without a problem",Negative
"This is an absolutely garbage game. It has plenty of potential coming from a first-time 2K player, but the company clearly does not care about their PC audience and refuses to put any effort into giving anything back to the community, rather electing to exploit them every year for money. I put 15 hours into my first player and then got a message saying that my MyPlayer account had expired due to not confirming my email address, even though I was never told to do so, and upon checking, never even received an email allowing me to confirm my email.",Negative
this game is a joke.. wayyyyy to many cheaters and griefers ruining the game. if red dead had invite only lobbies like gta 5 it wouldnt be a problem but nooooo. refunding this trash.,Negative
not recommended if you are going to try and play offline. Rockstar game makes it a serious pain. I have done every recommendation to fix the problem and it still will not let me play offline. if I could get a refund I would. I don't like to pay someone for a product that does not work. I bought this game in 2019 played it once offline. then set it aside for about a year. when  tried again to play it I had to go online and reactivate my rockstar account. Still it would not let me play offline. I have tried multiple times since and attempted all fixes but to no avail. and rockstar like most big entities makes it impossible to contact them.,Negative

It's an ok Diablo hack and slash with some fun stories and loot drops. The lack of summoning builds is a little lame but it's fun.However the biggest issue is the always online requirement. Servers are unstable even years after the games release. There are often hours where you can't play or even know if the servers are back up. Just replay the older Diablo games or do another PoE run instead of giving Blizzard your money.,Negative
i really dont like it,Negative
trash,Negative
Game crashes on 512gb lcd Steam Deck. Upon restart the deck has to verify system file integrity. This game should not be deck verifed.,Negative

Literally the gift that keeps on giving. It started out funny then slick became the  best game of this generation.,Positive
game crashing after every a match or two,Negative
Couldn't play the game as I had forgotten the email I used with the rockstar launcher. If you lose access to that email you cant make a new account using the same steam account. Rockstar support was as helpful as a rock. Now I can't play any rockstar games with this steam account.,Negative
Game no longer works on PC. I keep on getting disk writing error when ever i try to launch it for the first time launch installs. Nothing online to fix the error so i have given up.,Negative

"If you play with audio on it really helps you learn to play the game, just make sure you listen to what people say before you click them away.

Third patch and somehow runs worse. Just spent 20 minutes building a freeway exit just for the game to crash. Game hasn't been horrible its just not ready to take out the oven yet. If you're thinking of buying this game I recommend waiting a few more patches and for a sale.,Negative
Probably the best modern warfare game on the market right now.,Positive
THis game is literally broken money grabbing scheme. it will damage ur love of the game. season pass on a 70 dollar game is just so greedy.ALSO YOU DONT GET THE ALL FEATURES OF THE GAME ON PC.

The game is fun enough until you get to ACT 3.  OMG the game is almost unplayable.  The loading lags are minutes long to take a few steps.  In it's current state i can't recommend it.  There's no reason this game was released with this kind of bug.  How is this GoTY material?!,Negative
"Garbage. Cannot play ""The Stream account is already linked to a different Social Club account. Please log in with that Social Club account instead"".",Negative
"Non stop crashes. 2 hour long patch updates. And every crash requires the game to recheck files, at least 60 minutes. You'll be wondering what's wrong with this game more than you actually get to play it. Its infuriating because if it wasn't so shoddily run it would be amazing.",Negative

"It runs so bad, it's incredible. I spend most of the time just trying to find out how to even run it smoothly and above 30... For me, the game is unplayable. I'm not going to spend hours just fixing the garbage of a game you made. It's possible that you fixed the gameplay and the game can be actually fun. But having to spend hours to just get it running is no fun at all. Idk how can someone give it a positive review when you need to spend so much time to make it playable.... If you run a potato PC and you don't expect fps above 30, you can play as expected. But that's the most you can get out of this garbage without having to change files of the game.... Just a waste of money",Negative

"I didn't like the original game but I wanted to get some winter holidays vibes so I decided to try to switch my brain to ""average PlayStation fan"" mode and enjoy the Miles Morales DLC which I got on sale.Overall, it is a great game about people of colour fighting the white male oppressor. Strong women, lesbians are also in this game. These topics are very important these days, so I am glad they are all in this game.I liked the dialogues, especially the dramatic ones with ""You don't understand - no, you don't understand! I want to save you, you want to save me, I've got to do this and not that because I am Spider-Man!""Other than that, there is nothing to add, it is similar to the original. an average mediocre PlayStation exclusive.",Negative

The visuals are inconsistent, the faces are plastic looking while landscapes are good, the dialog have the floating head syndrome, the writing is super corny, the combat is just pure garbage with super clunky controls and hit detection as bad as can be, just can't recommend it.",Negative

"So many gaming sins here.Claw grip controls...This game is getting nominated left and right, whilst it dedicates to a controller scheme where you can't run and move the camera at the same time...And no pause button - ""duuh bloodborne didnt have one so we wont have one either duuh"" if this game is just going to 'follow the crowd' blindly then theres no hope for uniqueness here. The only way this game so far tries to be unique is in its pretentiousness, taking things like health and mana and renaming it into nonsense confusing stat names.And the stamina decreases way too quickly for how slow you run and boringly wide these environments are. This is such basic stuff to completely fumble right off the bat, why should I waste more time when around every corner is a new terribly implemented gaming thing.Also, they charge you extra for the non-refundable deluxe upgrade in the UK compared to the US. Hope the greed was worth it.Im not fanboi, lords of the fallen, the mess that it is, is more unique and daring than this, and allows you to pause and run whilst moving camera and has quality of life things like items remaining in place even after dying  And doesnt try to be pretentious - my point being that lies of p isn't really trying to do anything other than look unique without actually being anything",Negative

I've always preferred dodging than blocking so it took some getting used to, to get down the perfect blocks for that benefit.

"I don't hate Diablo IV, in fact I think its a moderately fun game. What I don't like about it is the need to be constantly connected to the internet which kills playing it on Steam Deck since you can not suspend the game without being stuck in reconnecting forever or just straight up booted from the game. Maybe if the reconnecting actually worked this wouldn't be a big deal but as is - you have to manually close out of the game and lose any progress you made. Not sure how that consider this Verified for Steam Deck. Additionally the constant pushing of DLC and seasons and the leveling experience this time around are not great either.I do enjoy the look and sound of it and can be fun to play on PC or Steam Deck but its unfortunate that they have chained this game to a micro transaction MMO model that is commonly seen on free to play games. If they ever give the option to play offline like with Diablo 3 I will change me review.",Negative

The web-swinging action is a marvel to behold, and the visuals are a treat for the eyes. When it's up and running, it's a thrill to play.However, a frustrating issue puts a serious dent in an otherwise fantastic experience - frequent crashes. These technical problems interrupt the game's flow and make it difficult to fully enjoy the superb mechanics and graphics. It's tough to stay immersed in the game when you're constantly worried about progress being lost due to these disruptions. Sadly, I had to request a refund.",Negative

"The games still has bugs where the goalkeeper passes to opposition players more often than in reality and the shot count vs. goals is too high as well. But the most displeasing thing is the player interaction, which basically whittles down any pleasure in long term playing. The players complain all the time for various reasons and you can placate them once, for them to complain again. Everyone wants to play all the time, even if they play poorly. Training results don't matter at all, as the ones that are marked as Important players and train poorly still expect to play and if you bench them, they complain that they are unhappy. Team morale plummets very fast, even if you win, if there's an unhappy top player.",Negative

However, the lack of major game play changes disappoints, making it feel more like an incremental update than a significant advancement. While the enhanced visuals are a welcome touch, the absence of groundbreaking features leaves enthusiasts yearning for more innovation. Here's hoping future iterations inject fresh excitement into the franchise.",Negative

"I get that the game needs to be hard and all, but making it so that my centre backs stand still so that the opposition players can score, it a bit much.Making it so that AI team's players who can barely pass a ball can score from 30m out is too much.Started off good, here we are at the usual place, permanent FM'ing.This being said, watch me get 1000h on this one.",Negative

"Civ VI is a pretty significant step backwards from Civ V in playability. The continued push to increase the complexity of the game mechanics prevents teaching friends to play, eliminates the possibility of casual play, and creates too many variables to keep track of to make it enjoyable. The UI buries key stats, spreading them across tons of views or buried deep in info menus that are often unreachable from the point at which you are making critical decisions like choosing a policy or government. You will mind yourself doing a ton of hand calcs trying to determine if a policy will be great for you or horrendous. You will accidentally screw over your own cities on seemingly small decisions since impacts are difficult to discover until after you've made a change. The decision to still tie city boundary growth to culture and limit city reach to 3 tiles while making every wonder and district take up a tile means that world building or even city building is a disaster.This is no longer a civ building game but a multi-variable calculus class masquerading as a game.To round it off, the game is often buggy, though not enough to significantly impede it.",Negative

"I cannot recommend this game, at least for Steam deck. While the story and gameplay are okay, the game simply won't run functionally on the steam deck without regularly crashing after an hour or so. The deck simply can't handle running it without overheating quickly, at which point it becomes unplayable. The frame rate in general doesn't hold steady to 30FPS too well, but it's smooth enough to play for that first hour. I wouldn't recommend buying it for the steam deck unless you only want to play for an hour at a time.It's like GTA but with some future tech RPG skill elements. Overall it's okay.",Negative

"I was instantly hooked when I started the game, but it all falls apart as soon as you make a mistakes later on.This game is well known for the permanent death mechanic. Early on and in the midgame, this is a fantastic mechanic that really punishes poor play while still giving the player plenty of opportunities to recover from their mistakes.Later in the game, though... If you loses a level 5 or 6 hero, you are looking at literal hours of grinding just to get back to where you were. It isn't interesting. It isn't fun. It doesn't create unique situations. It wastes the player's time with mindless grinding. By this point, you have most of the best trinkets, have seen almost every boss, and are just trying to finish up the game. Being forced to spend hours grinding for levels is not a fun mechanic, and the game does nothing to make leveling any faster.If you have tons of time on your hands, maybe this isn't such a terrible thing. Though, if you have that much time, play something more engaging and interesting.I want to love this game, but I just can't bring myself to finish it after losing a few max level characters to a combination of poor play on my part and an absurd amount of critical hits. Level grinding is an outdated mechanic that ruins the endgame of Darkest Dungeon.",Negative
"This is one of those games that the graphics make it look dumb, but it's actually... Well. You've probably seen the other reviews.

"This is probably the worst thing I've ever seen. 100 years from now when I'm dying on a hospital bed and I'm asked what my biggest regret was it will be that I turned on my computer and played fallout 76 on that fateful day... I will never be able to recover from this. No amount of therapy will save me. No amount of prescription pills will let me recover. I am a shell. This memory is so bad my brain is physically rejecting it and now I have a headache every time I think about it. Why did you create this, thinking it was a good idea? You've permanently ruined my life because of this, I hope you're happy. I hope that one day this gets branded as a war crime and you get hauled off to prison, never to see the light of day again. The fact that you're already not in a psych ward for insanity is so baffling I have lost all faith in every kind of justice system. If you subscribe to any religion, you'd best spend the rest of your time atoning for this ultimate sin. Have a terrible day, I hope this creation of yours haunts you in your dreams.",Negative

"The game has a ton of great ideas but it is a massive killjoy in my opinion and leaves me asking ""do I enjoy this game or do I slog through the game to get the things I enjoy?"".The pacing of this game is pretty bad. I am constantly inundated with forced tutorials that I really don't need, forced into or out of the ocean when I had other plans for progression, or weirdly held back from upgrading things because I haven't waded through said forced content.DAVE THE DIVER, as the title insists, has very limited game mechanics. This isn't even a bad thing really, I think it says a lot that the game is so popular and enjoyable with such limited mechanics. That is not to say that there is not much to do, just that the core gameplay is effectively just a handful of the same actions in different flavors. So it is a good game to chill out wi.....................except whoops you died so whatever you just did was meaningless. I could use an autosave every once in a while in the ocean especially in this ADHD format.I really like the restaurant stuff, in fact I would love to run the restaurant and use the diving to fuel it for the most part. Instead the restaurant comes and goes with the haste of an underpaid escort while you are thrust back into the ocean to do the same few things again for the billionth time. Oh god why am I already tired of diving in a game about diving?The game is obviously well done but I just find myself being more unhappy than happy so I don't need to force myself through the remainder. If you choose to buy this game I hope you enjoy it, but I just feel annoyed more than anything else.",Negative

"Same copy paste games as every year. No focus on making game play better, just focused on micro transactions pedalled by shills on twitch. Game is now at the point, after 12 hours of play, that it wont even open and gives error messages for GPU drivers out of date. GPU drivers are at the latest version, tried roll back still doesn't work.No help from steam as directed to EA Sports, whose app also just crashes and wants to send error reports every five minutes. Waste of time and money.",Negative

"While I have over 100 hours in Starfield, you could say I got my ""money's worth"", but looking back I really didn't enjoy it all that much and I can't recommend this game.  Too many aspects are designed to make the game be more tedious than fun, some quick examples being the encumbrance of items and vendors only having enough credits to buy one item from you at a time so you have to sit on a bench and wait three in-game days for their credits to refresh.  So you can either pick up items and end up slow walking through most of the game and spending 45 minutes to vendor it after every quest, or you can ignore picking up items and just be poor, but since credits are so important in this game it just makes no sense to put so many restrictions on looting and selling.  The shipbuilder mode, albeit clunky, was absolutely my favorite part and easily where over half my time went.  It reminded me of building Lego's as a kid, it's just a shame that the actual space exploration and dog-fighting is so poorly utilized and such an underwhelming part of the game.  Shout-out to the modding community for doing their best to fix this game, once I downloaded some mods to iron out all the jank and tedium I started to enjoy it more but in the end it just isn't enough, the game is just too half-baked and ends up being a real slog to play through.   If you have the Bethesda itch you're much better sticking to something like New Vegas or Skyrim.",Negative

It's not accurate it's not as accurate as csgo why launch the game if it's not accurate.,Negative
"The game is good, not great. The story and artwork are what keep me going. The game mechanics is poorly executed. For instance, when I approach my horse it would be better to display the contents of my saddle bag and what the horse is carrying. Instead I have to use a button, then another button to select an item. It is confusing. It is the same with weapon and item selection...Confusion. Why not have a menu similar to Fallout 4 and 76. Simple! I hope that this wheel menu is not the future of gaming. Aiming is crap to put it politely. I will continue to follow the story, but it will take months. I can only take about 45 minutes to an hour of the game. Seems like more work than actual fun.",Negative

The best way to describe the spiderman experience would be something like this. Basically you are                                       going to restart the game every 20 minutes or every time you take a fast attemptat a challen                  ge mastery.game is great but annoying to restart so often. the software for Sony has stopped asking for crash reports at this point. basically not a fully functional game. If i didn't buy it on super sale i would be extremely mad. Not a AAA title.Not worth full price.,Negative
"Product received for freewhat can I say about this game that hasn't been said already. This is my favorite game of all time and I have sunk so many hours into it.

Good graphics, fun game play, awesome dlc, and an amazing community. The only thing i can really dock against it is how expensive the dlc is, but i think that it is completely worth it",Positive

"This game was pretty great, and then me and my friend got to end game. The free specializations you can immediately unlock are fun, but the system to unlock the next ones is absolutely atrocious. I am currently attempting to get ""Firewall"" and the ""kill enemy or named enemy with while they are afflicted with X status ailments"" got old pretty fast. It is always fun to play ring around the roses with a named enemy that will do any thing and everything to avoid anything that involves the very concept of a status ailment. It is also wonderful when you have a status ailment on your weapon, the enemy is suffering from said status ailment,you kill them, and it doesn't count for some reason beyond your understanding. But don't fret, if you don't want to deal with this absolute not garbage tier system, you can always buy the 1 year pass and get ""Firewall"" without all the hassle. How lovely, I just love it when companies decide to pad their game with terrible systems and then offer a ""way out"" by presenting your wallet to the screen to the vacuum everything out of it.This kind of thing should be expected though, it is Ubisoft after all.",Negative
"Great looking game with nice gameplay mechanics, however the voice acting is awful with little to no emotion expressed with terrible sound quality. Being pulled into a cutscene following the completion of a task, or just talking to an NPC  is so jarring it completing takes away from any immersion that the rest of the game provides. Complete waste of potential as its enough to ruin a story driven game.",Negative

The game is quite packed with content and activities, yet it manages to keep a relaxed vibe without overwhelming you.The core loop involving diving for ingredients, managing your restaurant, and progressing through the game in a role-play fashion is rather engaging. I found myself more invested in it than in most roguelites.I decided to share my thoughts after completing the game, and I can genuinely give it a warm recommendation.

One of the most overhyped games ever to release outside of anything Final Fantasy. The only thing carrying this game is the artstyle and the narrator...that is it...that is all that is worthwhile in this game.At the highest level of difficulty the only thing worth running are hit chance increases and building to stunlock the enemy while reducing stress and healing. That is it. Same thing every dungeon...no variety.Of the different character classes you can have in your party only like 4 or 5 are really useful. The rest are just not that great.No real replability despite the initial illusion that it might have some.Fanboys are cancerous simps.,Negative

"I haven't played this game for very long, but I ran into a serious bug where I couldn't harvest anything. So had to rely on my team to gather food and a lot of the resources for me. But regardless of the bug I don't think it would change my opinion of the game very much. This game is boring. The crafting mechanics are fine, but there's nothing that separates it from other games that have crafting. There doesn't appear to be any sort of goal other than survive as long as you can. It's visually boring. All islands look basically the same and when you're not on an island it's REALLY BORING. I guess if you really love survival style games and crafting maybe you'll enjoy this, but there just isn't any depth to this game.Maybe the game gets more interesting the longer you play, but it's so boring so quickly that it doesn't feel worth it to keep going.",Negative

"The game was so fun at the start when I was just catching fish and running the restaurant but the devs try to make this game so boring for some reason. So many ""tasks"" that you have to complete are you just holding spacebar and carrying an object underwater from point A to point B, no challenge, no fun just tedium.There's an underwater fish people village that you visit early on and while that sounds really cool it is one of the most boring parts of the game. The villager quests are so boring and uninspired once again consisting of the same hold space here and move to here mechanics.A good example of the devs realizing how slow this game is yet doing nothing about it also happens in that village. In the underwater village you move so slowly and the village is massive, simply crossing across it is a 2 minute excursion. The devs must have realized that because they added a underwater taxi that you can ride only in that village, except it triggers a cut scene each time you summon it, it disappears whenever you go into any building and it uses that villages exclusive currency each time you summon it again. Thereby making even the fast travel slow and punishing.Can't wait for the sequel to this game where you manage a paint drying business.",Negative

I started by verifying integrity of game files, reinstalled the game, reinstalled nvidia drivers, ran in admin, and skipped the CD project red launcher using ""--launcher-skip"" in the launch options, but nothing changed. Also, my computer specs should be well above the minimum required to run the game.I have been trying to launch the game for a couple days with no success.

"Fun game. I enjoyed exploring planets, setting up outposts, gaining skills and cool equipment, and killing bad guys. But it still has WAY too many bugs. Bugged quests were filling up my quest list, and then I reached a point in the main quest where I simply can not play anymore. I'm stuck drifting in space.I'm tired of reloading old save games to try to find a point where I can do... something.Maybe in a year or two when they work out some of the bugs?",Negative

"Fun gameplay, when it actually functions. I bought the game because i heard the stability issues were better than when it launched. My god this must've been a disaster a year ago. I thought I was having PSU issues with my PC because this game constantly blue screens my entire PC. I've never got more than 2 games in a row without my PC blue screening or locking up so that i had to manually power cycle it with the button on my case. Crashing is one thing, but this game is probably harmful to your PC. How they haven't fixed this in 2 years is pitiful.",Negative

"Overall a great game that's very enjoyable.  Building an empire feels very satisfying and there is a lot of depth that isn't immediately apparent, such that I am still learning new things about how game mechanics work despite being hundreds of hours deep in the game.  In some ways this might be seen as a bad thing in that it signifies there isn't a lot of transparency in the game on how things work, but that's not the case for the most part.  For the most part it's just that there are so many things to do that until you look each one up in the in-game civilopedia you only understand the basic concepts and not the behind-the-scenes mechanics.There are some things I would love to see improved in the next iteration, like combat.  Especially the way simultaneous-turn multiplayer combat is handled.  Right now in multiplayer it's kind of a click-fest to see who attacks with their units faster.  I can empathize with the devs because it's hard to come up with a perfect way to fix this.  When a combat starts, do you just kind of pause the game for everyone and wait for all units on either side to take turns making attacks?  That wouldn't be fun for players not in combat.  But if you allow players to just attack each other at full speed in real-time, it creates an element of a real-time-strategy game that feels out of place given that this game is turn-based.  My idea for this would be to just adjust the way that combat works to give less of an attacker's advantage except in the most extreme circumstances.  For example, if a slinger attacks a warrior, the warrior shouldn't just sit there and lose half its health.  They should engage each other simultaneously so it doesn't matter if the player with the warrior clicked first or the player with the slinger clicked first.  The only times this wouldn't be the case is when attacking from more than 1 range, such as an archer 2 hexes away, in which case having a melee attacker run all the way across 2 hexes wouldn't make sense and some advantage should go to the player that is using range.  That being said, if an archer is attacking something that can attack back like another archer, they should simultaneously attack each other whenever either player attacks so that it's more fair and isn't just ""who clicked first"" or ""who is host and has less delay.""But other than the multiplayer combat issues and some minor multiplayer desync issues the game is a blast",Positive

"Gameplay is great, just like the first. Setting not as cool as the original, I liked how the original emphasised the whole virus outbreak thing. It is there in this one, but is just not as emphasised, so the post apocalyptic setting could be caused by anything.The story is kind of lame and boring. Very unimaginative, no emotional  investment in the characters. The enemies are banal. There is no serious thematic explanation as to why they are the bad guys. I suppose you could try to get invested with the audio lore etc, but I felt the original did this better with the post virus apocalypse.",Positive

so why cant i adjust my resolution to help with performance no option for full screen the only way round i have found is to set my desktop resolution to 1080p to trick the borderless into lowering it im running on a 3090 and its the only way i can stop the fans spinning up into jet engine mode so i can actually hear the boring dialogue lol i doubt bethesda bot will reply to this one lol,Negative

"The game is okay, I guess.However many centuries in the future, colonizing space and you have to walk ---or jet pack everywhere? That make zero sense. I've kind of stopped even flying anywhere, what's the point when you can save yourself three or four load screens and just fast travel. Most recently I have had to stop playing all together because of the you can't save glitch. Good times. The game is meh.",Negative
"The game is wonderful, they have done a great job, the changes made to Wyll in patch 5 were not asked for nor should they be mandatory.  No point in playing a game and having the developer make unnecessary and unwanted changed to the game midway through play.",Negative
Slow paced game. Not recommended  for  those  seeking for some  action,Negative

Remnant 2 is much better,Negative
"This is one of those games that is really hard to recommend unless you have friends who can play it with you. The mechanics and controls can be a bit wonky, the visuals are a tad generic with not a lot of personality and combat encounters can be really rough, especially since this game doesn't really feel like it was built for it. The map is also huge, so huge and seemingly endless that it's super easy to get lost, making it rather difficult to keep yourself on track for the overall quests and questline. I guess if you don't mind getting lost on the ocean for long periods of time and have some friends who aren't super concerned about story progression, maybe you could get a few nights of fun out of it. Solo wise, I wouldn't bother.",Negative
ultimately its pointless,Negative
"Laggy on a machine that can run RDR2 at 120fps.Should never have released in this state. No modding, no DLSS - crummy performance. Stupid design decisions and even worse decisions about release.",Negative

"Not worth for now. Every single edition we need to wait for patches to patch some obvious stuff, like competition rules and some bugs that are carried over version by version.But now, for FM24, the deliver has a lot of problems, like the players tutoring, overload of gols from throw-ins, excessive complaints by the squad about lack of depth. And not to mention the J-League licensing issue with some players missing.This is not how we deliver a full game after the paid beta access where they had some feedback about those issues.Now to play it we need to wait one month for the first patch? And will it fix all the stuff? I don't know...",Negative

I have to play two times Normal and New Game Plus because it was to short. The City is ugly and there is not to match to do. Story is OK but there are no bosses. First 15 minutes of the game is most interesting. The combat is boring.,Negative

I like the fact that this game plays perfectly fine on my old work PC. There is such an insane amount of dept that I can hardly imagine playing through all the DLC.,Positive
Epic!,Positive
Very graphic game. You have freedom to do things you'd never think of doing.,Positive
Closest we'll get to Bloodborne on PC and actually a very good Soulslike.,Positive
"Decent game, awful graphics.What I hate the most is the checklist they added for maps completed with each character. Are we supposed to complete it? It would take forever and the hardest maps with the weaker characters would be horrible. Why not just a 'records' tab which gives you the information without the checklist?Then there's the fact that they keep adding achievements every few weeks so you can never consider the game completed.And lastly the coop, why would you limit it to local?",Negative
awesome as always,Positive
I dont agree to any eulas every start of the game.,Negative

"boring, lame, made for children but takes itself way too seriously, over rated, very over rated. If you think you'd like this game chances are you already like it but if you think you'd hate this game chances are you won't like it. It's a fine game just not made for me and if you think the same way then its probably not made for you either.",Negative
"If you're looking for the feel of Sekiro. it's not the same. the parry frames are way shorter, the combat doesn't have a flowing feeling like most fromsoft games. I love the Idea and the designs, however the combat feels lacking",Negative

"Just rolled credits on this one after 60hrs as the Dread Pirate Roberts.  Really enjoyed breaching enemy ships and adding them to my fleet. Main quest is fine, but the faction quests were the most fun.",Positive
Its Cool!!,Positive
This game lacks basic settings like V-Sync and the ability to hide the build number. This means you'll be playing with massive amounts of screen tearing and a burned-in watermark in the bottom right of your screen. This is unacceptable in 2023.,Negative
diever,Positive
"This is as good as a competetive game can get, except the cheating is such a constant issue.You are guaranteed at least one cheater in your team and one in the enemy team, and sometimes you will be the only person in a game not using walls or radar hack. I cannot recomend getting into a game like this at this point. Go play anything else, its not even a good game for the professional scene anymore.",Negative

Plain and simple they did not deliver on what their incredible marketing campaign promised!,Negative
"Honestly, this game is not good. Amazing lack of detail in the world. No maps? Like really no maps and fast travel is awful. A lot of the quests are just walking back and forth.The shooting mechanics is the only thing that is half decent.",Negative
"Very fun, although short experience. The game takes the fundamentals from Spider-Man PS4 and adds new exciting elements especially to the combat that are unique to Miles. I really enjoyed the story in the game, although not extremely in depth it was short and sweet. Very good port of the game as well never really experienced any issues with the game",Positive
This game is only fun with extreme modding.  The game by itself just feels like a series of smaller games loosely sewn together. Civ 5 had its issues and this game just took them and made that a game.,Negative
"on low settings with small city its fine, once you get to the 100k mark the simulation itself starts running slow. car takes an hour to get from one side of the street to the other.",Negative

"Terrible and laughable compared to other battle royal games I've played. Graphics are a pixelated joke. Homefront 2012 has better graphics than this game. You cant see anyone. I only played one match before giving up on the analog controls of just basically moving. Lags like crazy and its so pixelated you can't see anyone. On console it gives you no tutorial on what controls do nor how they function except ""training"" which is not training at all. For some reason strafing makes your character run and move faster but walking forward is like tippy toeing and clicking to run is a mess as the game does not properly read inputs from controller or it just works odd. I found my thumb aching after jamming the analog so many times trying to figure just how to normally move, what a joke! Even low sub par games don't have that issue. Nothing explains how or why this works in game. Yet you can move faster crouched? Lmao. This game is a joke. Not to mention the countless bugs and hackers. My first match the game had several bugs and 2 people hacking the match. I quickly Uninstalled and never looked back after having it for less than an hour. Not even worth it. It makes no sense, nothing explains what anything does and the controls and games is laggy, poorly performed, bad inputs, laggy multiplayer. God awful graphics that are so pixelated on console it makes any PS2 game look like next generation graphics. Dont buy. I happily ran back to my other battle royal games that function 10x better.",Negative

this game is also good but in my opinion not an improvement to civ 5. I cant get over the art style it just makes epic moments feel silly. Overall i played for quite a while but ended up going back to civ 5,Negative
Not worth 49.99. I beat the main story in just over 9 hours. If this were cheaper than I would be much happier,Negative

"The biggest money grab game on the market to date, Ultimate team is not what it used to be",Negative
"I started playing this game because a friend recommended it for me. I like how you have big quests, but there's no deadline to complete them. You can just farm and everything is okay. It's a very relaxing and cosy game, and there are lots of mods to make it even better. I just really love the game.",Positive
"People are pretty chill and nice, and tend to give newer players and lower level players stuff like Stimpacks and weapons to help them out. In short, pretty chill community.",Positive
The game looks beautiful but plays horribly.,Negative
gud,Positive
"I enjoy BGS games, and I enjoy this one but honestly they just took it out of the oven a little to early...",Positive
"while its a fun experience in general this game is plagued with small ridiculous bugs that really hinder it from really being a good game, bad spawns, inconsistent hit reg, thermals that dont even show people on them and just a bunch of other small stuff that really seems minor until you start adding all the minor things up, turns into a pretty aggravating experience when at first glance seems fun, just another example where micro transactions stand at the forefront of the dev team attention, instead of a polished game",Negative
Played this game again on Steam after finishing the 1st run on the PS5.Great and short Spider-Man adventure focusing on Miles' unique way of being Spider-Man.,Positive

i am giving a review. bad. lots and lots of weird colored people.,Negative
"It's very much worth it on sale, but what people don't point out is the awesome Descent roguelite mode that is pretty much worth buying the game for alone, even if you don't like those genre of games this one is actually fun.",Positive
The game has a stupid meta of adjacency bonuses which ruin the experience,Negative
"Product refundedI requested a refund for three purchases of in-game credits, but Steam did not refund the credits, but instead issued a refund for the Battlefield 2024 game. Stop refunding the game and request a credit refund!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Negative

Addictive and tasteless,Negative
"For the price its definitely worth it. But i'm uncertain why this game is so highly rated yes its fun for a few hours but than after you figure out how to actually kill vampires efficiently it officially gets so boring its mind numbing. Gameplay loop is more basic than any other game you will ever find. Quests seem irrelevant run and grab quests that from as far as I understand do almost nothing. But keep in mind this is like a walking simulator because you don't actually control the attacks other than what direction they will travel.But I keep seeing comments saying this game is highly addictive and i just can't get behind that. I think Path of Exiles offers more entertainment in spades.I will still say yes for other people to buy this game though because its price is so low. But keep in mind its hard for me to imagine someone enjoying this game for more than 10 hours, I'm sure you can but I feel like the gameplay doesnt offer anything exciting once you figure out all the item combos.",Positive
I wish Astarion was real.,Positive
"this game does not feel like an assasin's creed, it's based off and got certain common items in between but it feels like a different RPG.if you're looking for an assasin's creed I do not recommend, but if you're looking for an insanely good rpg that's fun and has a large map to explore I recommend",Positive
Still just as good as when it came out! I return to Portal 2 pretty much on a regular basis. Love it!,Positive
The game doesnt even launch,Negative
overhyped. mid game with good art and a good theme. pretty poor mechanics and a blatant and uninspired fromsoft copy with terrible execution. would have given this neutral if i could but the mechanics are too frustrating,Negative
"i play many games of this sort, soulstone survivors, halls of torment, and supposedly  this one blows them all away overwhelming awesomeness, and i think it's crap. the movement speed is way to low to start, the abilities  to one dimensional left right up down bury you in choices that really kinda of suck, suffer long enough you can use to gold to maybe get something done. no this is a major no for me i'm aware im an outlier",Negative
"Frequent crashes, bugs, bugs and bugs everywhere, then another crash, more bugs and that's pretty much all it does. It simply isn't playable. It isn't even worthy of the label ""early alpha"", they have YEARS of bugfixes ahead of them until it's anywhere near ready to be released as a beta and maybe they can honestly launch it as a playable version 1.0 around 2035.",Negative

"It's an unbelievably 'ok' game. If Steam had a mid rating then I'd give it that. Though I'm swayed over to giving it a negative rating due to the loot boxes. Buy it on a steep sale if you want it that bad, though you'd probably enjoy yourself more going back to the first Division game.",Negative
"No matter how many words I use to describe this game, it won't be enough. So let me just put it in one word for our convenience. AWESOME it is.",Positive
"Completely broken and unbalanced. Essentially you roam around from one loose run of quests to another with no real direction. There's no boundaries to where you should or shouldn't be, which means running into random mobs that are far higher than you are. You'll be sent into quests you're not ready for, and given swaths of gear you can't use until level 50, at level 18, and even those weapons suck comparatively. Pair that with a completely pointless MMORPG options and you've got yourself the worst of the Fallout franchise. Seriously, if you're a fan of the series, DO NOT purchase this BS.",Negative

This is one of the most satisfying games i have ever played.,Positive
is very good,Positive
This game is boring. You cannot play five minutes without running in some video sequence. The combat makes no sense. It is mostly just hit with the spear or shoot an arrow. Even in combat there are video sequences in between sometimes. You cannot get any flow.,Negative
"Do you want to explore an untamed universe? Do you want to experience cultures that have developed separately into their own distinct people with the influence of the environments they've settled? Do you want to go raiding and pillaging with your space pirate crew? Do you want to explore interesting planets? Do you want to prepare for dangerous hazards of a hostile alien planet? Do you want a challenge? Or do you just want to experience an interesting story?Well this isn't the game for you.You'll be jumping around with loading screens through disconnected bubbles where there's not much to be found, running into the same NPCs over and over again. You get to experience bland 21st century Americanized monoculture all across the galaxy with very little if any distinction even between factions which supposedly hate each other. Almost every NPC in the game is lawful-good and will hate you for any even morally grey decision making. The planets and dungeons on them are cookie cutter, which was expected, but not tastefully done. The procedural generation is bare bones and the AI of alien creatures is laughably basic. Don't expect to find any massive kaiji-esque creatures, either. I don't think I encountered anything any bigger than an Elephant or Giraffe. Doesn't matter how cold, hot, radioactive, toxic, etc a planet is. So long as you don't face two hazards at once, any suit will keep you safe. The game is dead easy, especially with some of the random look. I found an incendiary sniper rifle that does double damage to targets with full HP and already has ridiculously high base damage as random loot. The story is uninteresting, as well. I've never actually gotten bored with a Bethesda main quest and gave up on it before. You have very little player choice, the NPCs you are meant to interact with are generic cookie cutter monoculture lawful-goods, and it's yet another chosen one story.You'll have a more complete experience by playing Star Explorers. This is perhaps Bethesda's worst RPG to date.",Negative

I played this game for 40 hoursEverything DeletedSad timesWhy?,Negative
Stop !!! If you're going to go into this game thinking it's going to be like every Bethesda game just don't open your mind to New horizons... I've played this game for 181.7 hours and my honest opinions yes it has bugs yes the loading screens do suck yes you do get to a point where things just blend in after 100 or so hours... But the games enjoyable and fun sometimes I get sucked into it exploring every little corner seeing if there's anything hidden doing wacky stuff.. and the story and the four main side missions are really well put together.. I say play you'll enjoy just don't go in thinking it's going to be like elder scrolls or fallout this is a new IP trying new things that Bethesda never done before and I can see the love and passion that they had when they were making the game... This game is a building block of hopefully what will come if there's a sequel...and lol please put out the creation kit ...,Positive

Well its Bethesda so you know there will be bugs, but i have only come by a few. I was worried about the stash box problems i read about but it was OK if you don't horde everything like me. I know the fallout 1st membership gets a hard time from everyone but i got a month to try it out and am willing to pay for it while i am still playing this game regularly, having a private world to mess around on is nice to just chill and farm junk after work. As for the story there is a ton of lore and quests, i didn't even talk to anyone for like my first 10 days i was so busy just running around checking stuff out.",Positive

"Regular crashes ruin the experience. Tedious grinding for resources makes the game a chore and combat is cumbersome and often unsatisfying. The amount of in game purchases are downright predatory.

I can't recommend it enough.",Positive

"I've played Civs 4-6 and Civ5 is the best one of them, so my negative review applies even more to other games in the series.Civ5 lacks meaningful interaction. Almost all decisions are internal.Most decisions are obvious, yet you still have to make them. Yes, this one caravan still will go the same route that makes me most money.Most decisions DON'T MATTER. Game lacks heavy, meaningful choices past early game.Late game is really boring.Nations are asymmetrical, but differences between them don't translate in differences in gameplay. Almost every nation plays the same.Combat is almost always meaningless. Most of the time you are not required to have any military units available to you and building them wastes a lot of time. Which means, the best move is always to befriend your neighbors and focus on internal affairs and economy. That reduces any player interaction to almost zero, because politics is shallow, superficial and pointless.",Negative

Writing the review in the hopes that BGS makes a chatGPT response. By the way No man's sky is more next gen than Starfield AND it came out on the PS4 and is even on the switch. Why are there so many loading screens and fake loading screens as well? I can skip a loading screen by taking the stairs but taking a elevator somehow forces me into a loading screen. It's almost like Bethesda doesn't know how to animate an elevator.,Negative

The combat mechanics feel heavy and clunky, the perfect guard is tedious, the dodge is short and slow, and the animations of those actions can't be interrupted.

"I definitely do not recommend it. There is no problem when playing with my 16 GB graphics card, but unfortunately the game either does not open or constantly crashes. It keeps the menus waiting for about 2 days. I worked for 1 week and read a lot of resources about this problem, but it still did not fix it. I think people have been working on this issue for 3-4 years, but they cannot get any results. Is the game good? It's hard to understand because it's not playable. Not to mention the problems and ruptures between Ubisoft and Steam. Unfortunately, it is obvious that no effort has been made on this issue and the problem has continued for years. I say this as someone who has bought almost all AC games. I messed around with my computer so much that it started to cause psychological damage to me. I deleted the game and now I'm trying to get used to my computer again by spending time playing other games. If I had known that returns would be accepted, I would have, but it was too late. I am someone who has never refunded a game in my life and I would do this.",Negative

"Does Portal 2 improve upon its predecessor? The answer is yes, but at the same time, improvements seem marginal to me, save for the multiplayer aspect, which was possibly the most meaningful addition, and the most fun I had in the game.Portal's 2 story, save for some moments during Cave Johnson's appearance and the upbringings of Aperture Science reveal, is as mundane than its predecessor's, with the writing resembling a Disney movie really. The ending is ridiculous, but in a bad way.Puzzles are the same level of difficulty as Portal 1, afraid to challenge the player in any way. Even though an easy puzzle can still be a good puzzle given the context, what was missing here was exactly that context, so I felt I was flying from one easy puzzle to the next, without exploring the possible puzzle space given the mechanics, or pondering more thoroughly about an interesting interaction.Traversal is improved, I actually liked the walking simulator-like parts and enjoyed exploring Aperture Science in its entirety.Overall, Portal 2 does not hold up today as people claim it does. There are much better games today, story-wise, gameplay-wise, design-wise, in regards to puzzles, mechanics-wise, and what they can make you feel and experience.",Negative

"At some point, the game becomes veeeeeeeeeeery boring and annoying. Do more tests so that you can do more tests then climb then climb then climb then do more tests and then some more. Yeah, yeah. The first game was simpler, but it had its charm. In contrast, Portal 2 was made to be more complex, but along with that it lost this charm.Of course, Portal 2 has some pros. It has some fun parts, defective turrets, Cave Johnson, airhead but hilarious Wheatley. References to the first part of Portal are nostalgic, scenery in some parts is honestly breathtaking. But for me, the most important thing was that the game is tooooooo long so it basically becomes really boring. I just wished for it to end faster, so that I complete it and am done with it.",Negative

"I was really hopeful about this. But it feels like they took the worst parts of tactical turn based games, explained nothing, and then added a system that takes away what little agency you have. The RNG might kill you in your first encounter in a level 1 quest, and with no way in the early game to deal with speed and hit chance, it felt like whatever I tried wasn't important. The initiative system makes all of the combos I was eager to try pointless.Ultimately when you get to surprise an enemy group, miss all of your attacks, the entire enemy party goes, then goes again before you in the next round, drives your characters insane and they begin skipping turns or auto-passing, you just get to watch an AI battle kill you and fail. And even when you win, you'll just ""randomly"" roll 4 more negative quirks across the whole party.Thoroughly disappointed, the negatives far outweighed the parts I tried to enjoy.",Negative

It's a very popular and cute game but in my opinion just fundamentally boring. I've tried it a couple of times and there are very obvious gameplay loops tied together to keep you engaged at different play time intervals. The mechanics themselves just don't grab your attention though. Can't get into it,Negative
This game is one of my alltime favourite games. It will forever remain one of the best games ever. Love you raft!,Positive
great for Pc's without a lot of ram,Positive

Restrictions to multiplayer for eggs and weapon number per player makes no sense.,Negative
"When I think about the worst, most unconscionable rip-off in my gaming history, I usually think of Diablo 3 as being the worst.  But that game was at least playable.  When I bought this at launch, it was literally unplayable.  I heard that it had gotten better, so I tried loading it up again, and it still doesn't work properly.  I'm trying again to get a refund-I know it's been 5 years, and they refused the first time, but they lost a lawsuit since then, so maybe they'll do the right thing.  Anyway, don't play this game.  Personally, I'm refusing to play any Bethesda game until I get a refund for this scam of a game.",Negative

"This game is deceptively fun. It is so satisfying to see the hoards of enemies getting destroyed, and upgrading your character keeps you very engaged and entertained. More importantly, this game gets so many things right that bigger titles don't. The upgrade system is fun, but not overly complex, which means you don't have to read instruction manuals or go through ridiculous tutorial screens to ""teach"" you how to play the game, you can just pick it up and go. What a gem!",Positive

"Huge improvement from launch, Still plays like an early access bethesda game.",Negative
"DUMB overrated game. I was playing on easy mode and got stuck on an endless loop of a shark eating me. It doesn't matte how many resources you have on you, you cannot build a raft without finding one... which in my case, probably didn't exist.You cannot at any point start from scratch. You have to baby sit your piece of scrap wood regardless of how many times more resources you have on you.  You cannot place planter boxes on an island or grow anything on an island. You cannot build rafts on an island. You cannot fish while sitting down. You cannot sit down on an island. You cannot place inventory on an island.Getting over it is a less frustrating game with less glitches.",Negative

"A once-in-a-decade kind of gaming experience. The amount of passion, ambition, storytelling, and attention to detail that Larian has put into this game is staggering. Yes, there are bugs, the inventory system is not great, and it has many other things that could have been better. But these flaws are nowhere near sufficient to make me consider this as anything less than a masterpiece.",Positive
this good,Positive
Wanted to enjoy this game but couldn't. Generic and boring. I'm not one of those weirdos that hated this game because the player character is too masculine or something though- let me make that clear. I dislike this purely on a gameplay level.

Get the mobile version instead. For some reason this version is unfairly difficult compared to the mobile version. I have no idea why they ruined the game like this.,Negative
"Story mode is just unsatisfying, you don't even get to make your own character for it and are forced to swap between multiple characters. Online mode is pointless unless you want to just get killed repeatedly by people who can't enjoy themselves without ensuring other people aren't enjoying themselves. Overall the game is just disappointing.",Negative
Very disappointed. Regret preordering this.,Negative

I'm not sure why this remains an issue years after the issue of this game but there is a audio stutter bug.  There are threads posted about this issue going back years. Redhook should have fixed this by now.It makes playing the game unenjoyable,Negative

BUG,Negative
"i have come to the conclusion that FM 24 is a unbalanced game, the problem starts from the match engine. AI will always have one shot one goal and a common theme seems to be how many chances i create and miss with elite players especially given how much higher my average XG is compared to the opponents and it's a recurring issue that happens over and over again, what else? players seemed to constantly given away the ball and defenders don't know how to defend. another issue is training players consistently train poorly even player who have high professionalism you have to constantly tell them they don't train well usually it doesn't work.my recommendation is wait to see if they fix the match engine until then its a very frustrating experience",Negative
"This game would rather involve two characters in a sex scene than actually focus on character development between said characters. If you want to shallowly fill a sexual fantasy of yours then sure, it's great. If you prefer a legitimate RP experience, then you're gonna be sorely disappointed",Negative
THIS TRASH IS TRASH COMPARED TO MY BELOVED PREVIOUS BF GAMES. YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF TO RELEASE THIS.,Negative

this game has been out for 5 years and still missing a lot of key basics needed in a survival game.  1.items cant be repair it breaks so you need to make a whole another one. you can simply get in the water to collect resources due to raft floating away and the shark that follows you through out the entire ocean. the one time use of an anchor to hold the raft in place is just crazy. then you need to make a new one. i like the concept of the game but it still needs alot of work after 5 years,Negative
Wait for the modders to fix the game.,Negative
Okay so I didn't put in 5k hours into this badly assembled and poorly animated mobile game but like I don't really understand the hype. It's bad on a technical level why are you putting in so many hours into it?,Negative

"The more I play it the less I like it, and I can't seem to force myself to go back to it. Good for about 10 hours then it gets boring. None of your choices matter in any way. Procedural generation for worlds and NPC's leaves it feeling hollow. If you've played a BGS game before you know what you are getting into. If you haven't, then I might suggest giving Skyrim a try then see if you want to play a worse game in space.",Negative
Best BattleRoyale There Is.,Positive
"Amazing game, the longest played game for me by far. I believe it's the processing power of my laptop but when you get far in depth in games, when you submit your turn it takes a number of minutes to come back to you, probably around 5 or more. Still an amazing game. I stopped playing this one and jumped onto CIV6 but the 5th one is almost just as good. Worth the money to upgrade but CIV5 will always be a recommended game in my point of view.",Positive

Pretty one dimensional combat system do to lack of skill customization and very limited positioning option.Missions feel either boringly easy or unfairly hard.Really sucks that you can't see what you roll or how likely you are to succeed at anything.Not terrible just so many better tactical combat games out there.,Negative
This game really does not want me to enjoy playing it.,Negative
Recommended for true football managers.,Positive
"Product refundedI wanted to like this, I really did. But the action is slow and clunky, similar to the Witcher 3, which I also did not care for even though it too has a big beautiful open world to explore.The excess of cutscenes also turned me off, even though some of them are skippable. The weird clunky crafting and upgrading system did not impress me, but by itself thats not enough to kill my enjoyment. Mostly its the annoying combat and climbing mechanics. If the basic gameplay is purely unenjoyable then I can't keep playing what was probably going to be a great story. Sorry Ubi.",Negative
"I really wanted to like this game, but there were some real issues that I'm guessing they've just fixed in Darkest Dungeon II instead.First of all, your biggest enemy isn't really the the enemies in the game, but the fact that your units get stressed out of orbit for pretty much just entering the dungeon or talking to each other. The game should from start have a way better tutorial and functions on how to relieve stress.Second problem, if you think the Random Number Generator is bad in XCOM, then you're going to have a real blast with this one. I know it's supposed to be a bit of the game failing and winning at random, but some runs have just been a complete waste of time entirely because of the RNG in addition to being new to the game.I would recommend this game for people who're getting back-seated while playing and for those who like to do pretty much the same repetitive thing over and over again.",Negative
The game looks amazing the story looks promising. I like the AC games because they go the extra mile in the architecture and history.Regarding the stability of the game... it is a complete disaster. The game crashes with no error showing. I looked at the forums and it seems that this is very common. The support is non existing. After sending them all the files they needed you get nothing.I wanted to buy the game with al the dlc included... I am happy I didn't.O and it will start crashing after 12h of gameplay.  So by by refundI wouldn't recommend the game.How Steam sell a game like this??,Negative

"Early Access ReviewVRChat, a platform that once promised boundless creativity and social interaction in the virtual realm, has undergone significant changes, and not all for the better. As an immersive experience, it still has its merits, but certain aspects have left the community divided and, in some instances, disillusioned.One glaring issue that has cast a shadow over VRChat is the toxicity within its community. What was once a vibrant and welcoming space for creative minds to showcase their talents has become tainted by a noticeable influx of disruptive behavior. The rise of ""quest users"" seems to have exacerbated this problem, leading to a more challenging environment for those who simply want to enjoy the platform without dealing with disruptive individuals.One of the most lamentable consequences of this shift is the pervasive fear of crashers. Users are now more paranoid than ever, and the once carefree atmosphere is tinged with anxiety. This fear has had a profound impact on the ability of content creators to showcase their animations and hard work. The very essence of VRChat, which thrives on user-generated content and creativity, is compromised when users hesitate to share their creations due to the risk of interference.Furthermore, the prevalence of ""mirror dwellers"" has become a source of frustration for many. These individuals seem content to spend their time observing themselves in virtual mirrors rather than actively engaging with the community. This behavior contributes to the perception that the platform has lost its sense of community and interactivity, with users becoming more isolated in their virtual reflections.However, it's important to note that VRChat still retains its core appeal for those who seek genuine social interaction and creative expression. Despite the challenges posed by a more toxic subset of the community, there are still pockets of positivity where users connect over shared interests and experiences.In conclusion, VRChat is at a crossroads. While the toxic elements and disruptions have marred the once-pristine landscape of creative expression, there is still potential for the platform to rebound. The developers have a crucial role to play in maintaining a healthy community, implementing effective moderation tools, and addressing the concerns of users. Until then, VRChat remains a mixed bag, with both the promise of immersive experiences and the looming shadow of a less-than-ideal community experience.",Negative

"Some parts of the game are nice. Specifically the quests. But the rest isn't there. No one thing in this game is done to it's peak, or as well as other games who have similar if not the same features. It feels a bit hollow, empty, especially when the worlds and moons sprawl unnecessarily far for what they contain, the nothing to see that they hold can be seen on hundreds of other planets, differing in ways that do not make any unique.",Negative
"I think I might be one of two people who doesn't actually enjoy the game. It's good, really! If you want a simple zone out game it's probably the best there is. I wanted something more akin to Smash TV or Crimsonland. Did I expect the wrong thing? Yes. Did I get bored after a level ran for 15 minutes on my fifth playthrough? Extremely. It's a well made, well supported game and I hated it.If you're a normal person this is great, if you're the kind of lunatic to beat Insanity mode on the original Mass Effect, move on.",Negative

"I really like the AC titles, some more than others, and with this one however... At 1st the game seemed promising, the idea of pillaging villages, running wild and free and conquering land and resources seemed pretty fun. But having said that, It was very painful to finish the main campaign. The Game is so extremely repetitive and boring after a while. Countless cut scenes and dialogues that lead to nothing. The main objectives are basically exactly the same, every time you finish the previous one. Sometimes when I was bored of the campaign I'd just load the game, find a lake and go fishing for hours. Also the Raven is pretty useless.",Negative

Riddled with bugs, and modders themselves have taken things into their own hands.Online lobbies are frequently stacked with people abusing mechanics and game options.Not a good time if you want to be competitive.",Negative

this game is almost entirely great but my god the final boss is not just hard it is frustrating. through out the whole game you get a summon for bosses but of course you don't get one for the final boss. the tracking is completely absurd so you better hope you are good at perfectly timing your blocks. and also the final boss is significantly faster than every other boss so no more charged heavy attacks for you. talk about artificial difficulty spike. i just decided to get the bad ending because it was easier than having to fight the guy.,Negative

All of the enjoyment comes from slot-machine style lights and animations.If you're looking for a cheap dopamine hit, then VS is definitely a good pickup. But despite immensely enjoying my time with it, there's a sense of regret now that I'm done with it.

I was going to just leave it be until I maybe had a better rig and there were some performance improvements, then consider picking it up again.But having watched people play it since and seen the various issues, seen just how ridiculous some of the bugs are, how repetitive and limited the assets are, the issues with mod support, and generally just how the entire thing looks like it was deep in Early Access territory on release day, I really feel obliged to slap a negative review on this. If I do pick it up, it'll be steeply discounted in the future and only if it's had significant improvements.",Negative

"If you love exploring and RPG then this game offers a lot of options. You can almost be whatever you want to be.  I can see great potential in this platform! There are so may 'quests' you can do in each city, on each planet,  that you find yourself sidetracked from what you set out to do.  As with other Bethesda games this game will evolve and grow into something that will be enjoyable for years to come. If you played the Fallout 4 without any DLC or mods you would think that's mediocre. Plus the Fallout games are set in a small area whereas Starfield has an expansive area with so many different biospheres.  I love this game because you can just go out and do what the heck you want to. Explore, build, become a pirate, be the strong force for good, or evil.",Positive

"This game is communist you can't be higher level then any monster.It's like Joe Biden that made this game and inflation always goes up each time you level up.After playing this game for over 24 hours and i'm level 45 it feel like a rock hit me in the head falling from the sky.And all I can say at this point is who ever made that system where you can never be ahead I hate you so much.It doesn't feel like diablo because you can never get ahead no matter what you do.The skill tree are so stupid max level 5 they made lame and slow, it's suppose to be insanely over power.But no some dumb person said max level is 5 you must be the dumbest person thanks for killing diablo 4And we waited so many years for this game they didn't put that much new stuff it's like the same spell they must be sleeping with their own family member for them to able to not add any stuff. It's basically diablo 2 and 3 mix but with a lot of nerf.  The storyline is really good which is the only good thing.I'm big fan of blizzard game I played played diablo 2 and 3 and I play wow warcraft 3After playing diablo 4 I like to say I'm not buying diablo 5 they ruined the game.",Negative

Not fun.  Most people play games so that they can build up a character.  The dynamic of this game is to defeat that and wear you down.  Killing your characters is common.  Combat dynamics of canceling character skills are common.  This is the opposite of fun.,Negative

"I feel this game is overrated. Everyone experiences games differently and this is just my opinion. There was so much hype around this game so I bought it. Frankly after playing for a while, I'm not sure why this game has so many overwhelmingly positive reviews. I found the game play to be OK. I found other games like Brotato and Enter the Gungeon with much more engaging game play. I do not find this game addictive as is mentioned in many other reviews. So when I say I don't recommend this game, it is because in my opinion it did not live up to its hype and felt like a waste of time. Your experience maybe different so give it a try and judge for yourself.",Negative

Super Casual but INSANE arcade fun!.. has local co-op mode.,Positive
I have never posted an online review for the previous versions of FM that I have bought. But I am posting for this one. Because I am so annoyed with the broken player interaction in this game. One player goes down a league to join 'a bigger club'. Other players with a 2 and a half star rating start demanding high wages as soon as you get promoted that dont merit their ability. Then the whole squad is unhappy with your treatment of that player because they too want a high contract. And this is all when they know that the club is 40 million in debt.,Negative

"Great style and sound design, addictive loop but it failed to keep my interest toward the late game, dramatically.I can accept it's a game of rolling the dice and it can go both ways, I wish the game would accept that risk as well though, the later you get the more you have to lose and yet all the mechanics of the game bend the odds worse against you, the RNG is bent further against your favor with no benefit to you and the only way to keep up is equipment RNG, when the end game makes it very likely you will lose people it puts into perspective how much fun it is grinding a character back to max and rolling for the correct equipment to even give them a chance at success. Not to mention the rest of the team being functionally worthless until you train up a replacement for their comrade, since naturally as you get into the harder levels, less optimal strategies fall off in efficacy, though I do question the decision to make almost every status effect based team near useless by late game, starts to feel a lot like railroading. Not very fun, not at all. I'd go as far as to call it monotony. Whatever their goal with this game was I don't think it was boredom, yet that's about all the late game gives me, that and a desire to play anything else.",Negative
Its just alright. No matter what difficulty i feel like all i get done is eating and drinking. Its just kind of tedious and boring. It has potential and maybe a raft 2 would be the game i want. But this one doesn't hold my attention. I think its more of a multiplayer game to get the full effect and i just don't like playing multiplayer.,Negative
"I can only recommend buying this game if its on sale. It is still buggy as all hell. They say the hit markers are fixed, but it still happens time to time.",Negative

"I wouldn't recommend buying this game. The exploration is boring, no terrestrial body I landed on left me feeling like I was the first person to land there, as they all seemed to have human structures on the surface. Plus a lot of landmarks were anything up to 2 km away which you could only get to on foot. You would often run into the same structures on multiple planets and moons, with often the same enemies.  The quests were OK, but a lot were randomly generated and would just repeat over and over again which became very boring. The constellation companions morals are all the same which makes choosing which one to pick almost pointless. The mod support is poor, half the mods have issues, you'd be better off playing Skyrim its a much better game. Overall there are better space simulation  games available then this. If you really want to try it wait for a sale.",Negative

The game has a lot of clever puzzles and fun gameplay, AMAZING story along with the soundtrack that is perfect in every situation that you're in. Even if you complete the main story it's still fun to replay thanks to the amazing portal mechanic and the fact that it's easy to forget solutions to some puzzles. If you get bored of that there is still a Multiplayer mode where you can complete new puzzles with your friend or a stranger. And on top of that once you get the hang of the game's mechanics you can complete other player's puzzles OR even try to create your own puzzle! The game is just amazing and i think everyone with a PC should play it",Positive

"Counter Strike 2 claims to be a cutting-edge gaming experience, but beneath its flashy graphics and intense gameplay lies a cesspool of frustration and disappointment. The primary issue plaguing this supposed gaming masterpiece is the rampant cheating problem that has infested the community like a virus, rendering the entire gaming experience virtually unplayable.The introduction of the so-called ""state-of-the-art"" anti-cheat system is nothing short of a disaster. Instead of effectively targeting and eliminating cheaters, it seems to indiscriminately punish innocent players who happen to have high DPI settings. This heavy-handed approach has created an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty, where players are constantly on edge, wondering if they'll be wrongfully banned for simply optimising their gaming setup for better performance.The anti-cheat system's obsession with high DPI settings is not only misguided but also a blatant disregard for the diverse gaming community. Many players invest time and money into acquiring quality gaming peripherals, only to find themselves penalised by Counter Strike 2's flawed system. It's disheartening to see a game prioritise false positives over legitimate players who genuinely contribute to the gaming community.Adding insult to injury is the developer's lackluster response to the growing complaints. The forums are filled with frustrated players sharing their experiences of unfair bans, only to be met with generic responses and a lack of transparency. It's evident that the developers are more concerned with marketing their faulty anti-cheat system than addressing the legitimate concerns of their player base.The prevalence of cheaters in Counter Strike 2 further exacerbates the issue. It's not uncommon to encounter blatant hackers who ruin the experience for everyone. From aimbots to wallhacks, the game's servers are infested with players who exploit vulnerabilities, making a mockery of fair competition.In conclusion, Counter Strike 2's promise of an immersive gaming experience is overshadowed by its incompetence in handling the cheating epidemic. The heavy-handed approach of the anti-cheat system, particularly its misguided focus on high DPI settings, has turned the game into a frustrating ordeal for innocent players. Until the developers address these fundamental issues and prioritise the well-being of their player base, Counter Strike 2 remains a disappointing and unplayable mess. Save your time and money for a game that values its community and delivers on its promises.First we had people being banned for just merely using Windows 7 as an operating system, then we had people being banned for having an AMD related graphics card and now we have people being wrongfully banned for having high DPI and fooling around by spinning at the start of rounds.",Negative

"The game itself is pretty good, however I myself only play once a week, and it seems the patches are very often, and each patch is over 100g each time to update, this makes it such a pain to actually bother playing, so, unless you're going to be playing it everyday then don't bother until they're done patching all the time.",Negative

"I loved Civ V, but Civ VI just isn't fun for me. Builders self destruct after 3 actions. The interface is glued to the corners and looks terrible on a 1440p display. It looks like 90s era UI design. There's no option to increase the scale unless I'm running at 4k. Accessibility options in general are nowhere to be found. I'm glad I waited for a good sale. I'd get a refund if I wasn't past the 2 hour mark. The visuals are great, at least. Not enough to save it for me.",Negative

"I can't understand how this game is getting so many good reviews.Broken game...Only able to make 3 subs in Champions League games. IRL you can make 5 subs in CL games.Reload simulator...The devs still think it's fun to implement random 3 month training injuries. Doesn't matter whether it would or would not happen irl, IT'S NOT FUN! Just load a pre-injury save.Clubs haemorrhage money...Even if you win a competition you'll have to pay the squad a collective bonus that's more than you received for winning the competition. Unmanageable if you want a squad that can challenge at the top level, as they all want the huge pot of gold.Ridiculous player demands...Even 16 year old future prospects demand 80k weekly wages.So many clicks...Everyday is at least 20 clicks. The game still doesn't navigate to your inbox when there's a message there. You have to click off all the bs the game is showing you to view every single message.",Negative

Early Access ReviewDISTASTEFUL. that is how i describe the new update. for starters. WHO IN THE RIGHT MIND THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD IDEA TO ADD TRANSACTIONS. a free game that makes you pay money to support people when its more likely to pocket most of it and give only a fraction of the little amount given back. two. THE GOSH DANG CONTENT FILTER. i get it you know. VR chat has way to many kids in the game and they should be protected from the harsh environment. but if you wanted to do that DONT MAKE IT SO THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE BELLOW 18 SUFFER. the minimum i think would be 14 maybe 15 NOT 18 SO THE REST OF US NORMAL PEOPLE HAVE TO SUFFER! so many of the avatars we either took ages to find or even upload. striped away from us because is has a content warning! great idea guys. round of a applause! so in short. VR chat has become nothing more than an underage kids playground where they can throw away there parents cash at to pay for stuff THEY NEVER NEEDED. EVEN REC ROOM WOULDN'T STUPE TO THIS LEVEL OF SCUM! even better?! they LISTEN to there COMMUNITY! unlike SOME PEOPLE! i have grown up with this game. and it pains me to say it. but after today. after seeing the derection there taking this game. i might as well cancel my subscription and find a different game to play. cus after this? there is no recovering from this! they have hit rock bottom! the only way to fix this garbage is to just restart it. take the game back a few years! why not?! it worked for fortnite! and everyone looooooved that?!. so in total. . wait for them to fix these problems OR DITCH THIS GAME,Negative
"""Raft"" is a PC survival game that sails above the rest with its captivating blend of challenge and charm. Set adrift on a makeshift raft in an endless ocean, the game delivers a visually stunning experience that draws players into a world teeming with marine life and danger.The gameplay mechanics are the heart of ""Raft,"" offering a perfect mix of scavenging, crafting, and survival. Starting with just a hook, players gradually build their floating sanctuary, constantly juggling the need for resources and the ever-present threats of hunger and dehydration. The intuitive crafting system keeps things dynamic, making each decision feel crucial to your virtual survival.One standout feature is the cooperative multiplayer mode, allowing friends to join the adventure. Together, you can build, explore, and face the challenges of the ocean, creating a sense of camaraderie that enhances the overall experience.While ""Raft"" excels in many aspects, the early game can be a bit slow, requiring patience as you gather resources. Some may also find the limited variety in environments and the repetitive nature of resource gathering a bit monotonous over time.In conclusion, ""Raft"" stands out as a captivating survival experience with its stunning visuals, engaging mechanics, and cooperative multiplayer option. If you're a fan of survival games, ""Raft"" is a must-play that offers the thrill of exploration and the satisfaction of building your own floating haven in a beautifully unforgiving ocean.",Positive

"Product received for freeto play this on normal difficulty, you have to eat and drink water tremendously fast, it made my girlfriend refund this game, maybe make the water stay replenished longer as well as the food stay replenished longer, would have made a better experience, yes I know there is a peaceful mode and an easy mode, normal should not be designed to eat and drink water every 5 minutes, I like normal because of the pve aspect and difficulty. 5 out of 10 is my rating. It definitely was not a skill issue, on the hard difficulty I would keep the game the way it is.",Negative
This game lost it's total uniqueness and It's boring to me now. BORING!,Negative
"Dave the Diver is joy to play, at least, it is until you make it to the end game. The storyline is cute and well-thought out and the mechanics are pretty front loaded, allowing you to get a good feel for the game quickly and start working your way through the game-play loop. There isn't much challenge to the game, and that's alright, the overall vibe, play and art style all lend itself to a comfy game time with little to stress a player.  This would definitely be a recommendation I'd put out for getting a pre-teen or early teenager into gaming.The controls of the game are tight, its easy to understand and the games advancement and upgrading is all very linear. Only the guns offer any sort of ""hunt down x"" that can get annoying, but even then, its not hard to figure out.I really have few complaints about the game, but they all have to deal with the ""post-game"" so to speak, so they don't really detract from the base game, which is a polished gem.Complaint 1.The ""Cooking Mama"" Mini-Games that pop up towards the end of the game really come out of left field, and feel unpolished in comparison to the rest of the game. They aren't bad, but I also don't feel anything would have been lost by just excluding them.Complaint 2.Dives start to take excessively long and become very repetitive post game and even leading into the post game. A ""good dive"" can typically end up being close to an hour or longer a pop. Which when there is incentive to go after the same fish every dive, it can feel very samey, very quickly and all the polish loses its luster.Complaint 3.After the story is completed, there's not a whole lot to do anymore aside from maybe 1 or 2 bosses, depending on how quickly you progressed, and just running bancho sushi. But when the vast majority of the game is spent on dives, it becomes disappointing that there aren't anymore surprises, its just achievement hunting. This can be especially troubling when its possible to demolish the game without much in the way of gun upgrades, and a staff that's only a quarter or slightly more leveled.  After that, it just makes things even easier.All in all though, I still adore the game and plan to get all the achievements before retiring it.",Positive
literally the most immersive game i have ever played.,Positive
"Really not as buggy or poorly-performing as some say, would recommend.",Positive
It is fun just to jump in and scout the areas. Very relaxing. I am new to the game but it seems fun. So far. only level 10.,Positive

Inventory system is horrific. Combat is dull. NPCs are just voids. Menus upon menus. And I honestly do not want the option to pick up every single coffee cup in the place. Space combat is TERRIBLE.",Negative

"It's fun mixture of advanced technology and bones and rocks tools and also mecha-dinosaurs and animal are unexpectedly a good touch to the game, and it has a REALLY big map for open world game which is nice and also the grind is not as much as i expected, one tip tho, every time u found or encounter something that can be collected do it, especially ridge sticks, you are gonna need a lot of arrows and also try to use your focus every time you're travelling since if u detect animals, crouch and ready to kill them since you need to drops from animals to further upgrade your equipment especially your arrows quiver since you can only hold a limited amount of arrows",Positive

"This is a wonderful civilization builder with lots of variety. It is absolutely a blast to play with friends. I really enjoy crafting my civilization, and there are many paths to victory with always more actions available than you can take.

"Wanna get this outta the way real quick. The final boss is absolute BS and should be so difficult. i know the game is perpetually meant ot kick your ass which is fine and its half the fun of the game hands down i enjoy that. But the final act is hands down some darksouls 2 BS with the game basically forcing you to cheese every last mechanic in the game to beat itAside from that it so long to understand a number of the basic mechanics of the game like leveling up or upgrading armor etc etc but when i put it all together the progression of that and rebuilding the town feels great and rewarding. The different classes are fun to juggle and that constant fear of characters going insane or dying is so rare to find in games but when it hits just right it adds another level on top of what is already a gerat game i wished i played sooner.Has really pushed me to try other games in this vein, like nadir, banners of ruin, slay the spire etc",Positive

One of them was lost while I was in my shelter, I was getting rid of junk, and making a new core, and it was gone when I turned around! It wasn't even 6 minutes!

It does have some major downsides which prevent me from recommending it.Game breaking bugs and other issues don't get fixed.- Whenever you load into GTA online, you get the same spam calls before you get together enough money to make them stop by doing what they ask. These are things that require 3 million, 6 million.... It takes weeks if not months for a new player to get this amount of money.- Online takes 6 minutes to load, on an SSD.- Floating uncontrollable van on the Motorcycle Club resupply mission.- Ammo disappearing in online which requires you to re-buy which is incredibly expensive.- Rapid fire bug that makes NPCs insta-kill a player out of nowhere.

Also its not fully pixelated? there's a bit of ""3d"" in it which personally I don't dig.",Negative
Great game with ideal improvements over CS1. Absolutely needs to be more compatible with avg specs. But I run at 45-55fps and it is serviceable. Would be infinitely more enjoyable if it looked better.,Positive

"I made it through most of the game before giving up due to buggy bosses.Pros- Story is interesting- Some neat combat ideasCons- The game itself isn't very difficult. It's just buggy combat- Zero stagger resistance against any attacks. If you get touched while swinging, oh well. Yet basic enemies take multiple power attacks with a heavy weapon to stagger.- Attacks not registering WAY TOO FREQUENTLY. Imagine a heavy swing at a boss at point blank range that swooshes through the air. Again, and again, and again, until you give up and write this review.- Bosses will switch attacks mid-animation. Seems they can cancel any attack at any point, and switch to any other attack. Just a jumbled garble of random half swings.- Seems every enemy has a small random chance to initiate a one-hit-kill instant out-of-nowhere attack if you're close range.- I did a particular quest where I needed to talk to a particular person, but when I showed up they attacked me. I killed in self defense, but then I couldn't complete the quest. What?",Negative

Controller support was stated to be added at a later date.  It is now November 25, 2023 and still no controller support.  The game isn't bad, but lacking modern controls and extra features found in other games has soured my experience in this game.  Maybe some day we'll see full controller support in this title.  I'll play it more then, and if the controls work properly I'll change this review.",Negative

"The game is good! Realy are! Of course if it can run on your's PC! Or if it able to connect on servers.

I just playing like a 10 minutes and then - connect lost, and next each 2 minutes is crashing! So I would recommend try it on EA Play, or on free-weekend. If it work on PC of your's - you're lucky! But if game is crashing - refund it, because it's can't fix in easy ways! At least I can't found solution. I played it before on PS5, and it not bad! But on PC it's just can't running.

"Dave The Diver is a fun, wholesome, and relaxing game that I view as a nice palate cleanser. In that this can be something you can play if you are trying to wash out the taste of a bad game you've played out of your mouth or if you just want to play something a little more simple and just relax.You can definitely tell that the developers put a lot of love into making this game and had some making it with its charming pixel art, chill soundtrack and a bit of quirky humor in between.The story feels like it's really just there for the sake of progression. Which is fine since it serves its purpose for what it's trying to do, but that's just it, it doesn't really stick with you. There are some points in the story where it does feel a little sluggish, but overall it has kept things interesting by steadily introducing new mechanics as you progress.Overall, I would say this a game that is worth picking just have something sit down, relax, and play. For it is VERY good at doing that.",Positive

It's a breathtaking Sync points, teeming with diverse environments, serene landscapes, and hidden treasures. Exploring every nook and cranny of this vast world is an adventure in itself. The attention to detail and the stunning visuals truly bring the game world to life.I can't help but express my love for this game! The combination of a captivating story, an abundance of quests, and a vast open-world map creates an immersive experience that keeps me coming back for more. It's a true masterpiece that showcases the talent and dedication of the developers.If you're a fan of captivating narratives, thrilling quests, and the freedom to explore a richly detailed world of vikings, this game is an absolute must-play.

"A disappointment to the Assassin's Creed series, even by the standards of their recent games. Initially, I'm annoyed by the lack of steam achievements, which the previous games have had.The combat cinematic are repetitive, and way less smooth than any previous game, which really sets a new low for the franchise. Though I can't put my finger on it, the general movement and climbing also feels very clunky. The intro to the game was breaking new barriers... for how boring it was. To top it off, it felt very devoid of emotion. Maybe they wanted a stoic viking, but that doesn't help me connect with the character.I've known Assassin's Creed to be the franchise to go to when you want a cinematic combat experience, but this game really shows how much they've strayed from that. Syndicate was the last game for good cinematic combat, and Black Flag was the last game for good story and atmosphere. Every game since Black Flag almost seems to be competing to be a bigger joke than the last.",Negative

"You never really feel challenged in a meaningful way playing 76. The game isn't hard, just tedious. The grind is immense. Equipment mods are locked behind obscure rng mechanics. Events are mind numbingly pointless. And ultimately for what? All of the high level players run around in power armor mowing down mobs in an endless repetitive cycle. The main gameplay loop is stale.",Negative

"looks awesome, feels awesome to play, and the setting is incredibly interesting, but the racism is annoying as hell.I love this game but I cannot in good faith recommend it, especially without pointing out how awful the appropriation and misrepresentation of indigenous cultures is.

"Devs couldn't figure out how to program an AI that could outplay a human so the AI cheats at higher difficulties with better yields, combat stats and starting units. Anything lower than King difficulty is a braindead easy compstomp, anything higher than Emperor is you getting obliterated by a balls-out-cheating AI that is 3 cities ahead of you by turn 25. Then there's a cute little animation of them telling you how much you suck. Counterplay in higher difficulties means cheesing broken AI more than employing any kind of real strategy. Survive until you can nuke cities, because the AI doesn't use nukes, for whatever reason. Late-game is also very static and uninteresting.",Negative

Went to Red Lobster would be a plus! In all honesty tho the game is great. But a lot of things fall short. Fix the parry window. For a game that expects you to parry a lot... its broken. The dodge as well. Such minor things holding back a wonderful game. Its been almost 2 months since release and no patches... No interest to listen to the community and fix simple things. Ill change my review upon some sort of patch...,Negative

"Glaring game design flaws keep this game from really standing out. The puzzles make sense to only the game designers who created them, zapping any aspect of challenging fun. They are boring and nonsensical, and you have to google the intricate details on how to solve them, really zaps the fun out. It shouldn't be that way.The narrator voice is absolutely horrid. She's sounds like a poor combination of trying to be dramatic in a sort of whisperer pillow talk kind of way. It is painful to listen to. I have come to just manually mute whenever she speaks since there is no other option. Such a shame because the rest of the voice acting is good with the characters.",Negative

Walk another 5 feet wait another 10 minutes. If you are unlucky the game will just outright crash loosing all of your walking progress and you will have to do the same song and dance again.

"The game is a huge waste of time. I really tried giving it a shot but after 70 hours I am done. The game is really bad in every aspect. The ""Assassins Creed"" from the game is missing. Its just a generic mobile game ad level RPG with a Assassins creed brand on it. Even if you take away the Assassins creed name the game does not hold up well on its own at all.For Example,There are 100 types of enemies but they all have only one or two attack animations that they constantly spam. That sums up the entirely of this game's combat, there is nothing more to it.If all that is not enough the steam version does this funny thing of crashing out to the desktop everytime the game tries to synchronise achievements which is 20-30 minutes but guess what? they didnt even bother adding steam achievements but the game has the logic programmed in it to do so and then crashes out when it cannot sync with steam.",Negative

"Raft would be a great game, but the story is incredibly stale. Not to mention you could be getting 20-30 fps when the graphic settings are set to low. This game was probably once great, but it has fallen.",Negative
The game feels dead. There is no music or anything. All you hear is the wind blowing the entire time. There is no atmosphere music. Some of the mechanics of the game dont make much sense. Like for example when you reach a checkpoint you cant always upgrade you stats for some reason. So most of the time I just loose all the points for upgrading before it finally allows me to upgrade.,Negative

I play these games for difficult fight but if I need to put in 26 button cheat code to unlock the hard part of the boss, I just don't want to play.

The game is very monotone, without any action, you just walk, walk walk and slowly shoot mobs, trying to collect EXP to lvl up.Too boring and over simplified game.",Negative

"I wan to recommend, I loved the first game so much. This one though, very rough and hard to play.The simulation seems completely awful, same game loop no matter how I build, sims can be easily manipulated and trade is not well connected.Honestly what drove me to write this review was the got dang sewers and water pipes. Connecting them is so infuriating if there is even a slight difference in terrain it is near impossible. They snap to different random places without connecting. After trying for 5 minutes to get a new sewage outlet connected I gave up and exited the game.",Negative

"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 69 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 1901 from his ""uncle"", so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 420 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching Tiktok. So i decided to make a Tiktok account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. It was all going so well until... I heard a loud thump upstairs. As I walked up the stairs, I saw pieces of what seemed to be a controller shattered across the floor. As I peeked behind the door, I looked at my Son and realised that he had killed himself playing this game. Now I have nothing. This game has destroyed what little part of my life still brought joy.",Negative

I like the game play a good story in it. I see that there are missions which can be sometime tiresome and seems like that can take lot of time. Either it should be immersive or one by one after one story mission. The side missions pop simultaneously and if you accept all those then you might not enjoy the story missions. Like out of 14 hours game play I have played 8 hours are side missions.Overall the game is good if you have not played then I would suggest you that you can play this game.,Positive

Loved the first spiderman remastered so naturally I picked up Mile's Spiderman. It was good and there were some nice improvements like the fighting was sped up and swinging around was a bit better. The only problem was I found it short. I finished the whole game in 19 hours.  Wish it had been a bit longer with some more action but it wasn't a bad game. I'm thinking this could have been a part of the DLC from the original Spiderman.  The important part is it was fun and looked great.,Positive

I tried it during the free weekend.  The only thing made me feel excited started and ended by the character creation screen.But maybe I'm too old to feel that kind of excitement I had for Dio 1 and 2.With the third I waited years until it got cheap enough for me to pay for a hot bubblegum color-themed something.And now this with the ridiculous price tags...,Negative
Improved? Yes. By a lot? Not yet. It's a lot better than it has been and the things added have had more of an impact than the past few versions. Now excuse me while I go play this game for a few thousand hours.,Positive

"As a longtime fan of Bethesda and space games, and also RPG's, it pains me to not recommend this game. Unfortunately, all the other reviews stating about how cookie cutter and bland the general act of playing this game is, are true. There are still countless bugs still in the game, that have made my current play-through unplayable.I think the thing that has always made Bethesda games stick out was that there were non limiting in playstyles and existed in lively and beautiful worlds. Starfield is unfortunately the exception to this. The only way you can play is using an assortment of the very bland and non-varried guns.I've tried all of the different quests and found a few quirky little places out exploring, but all in all, it's bleak. I hold out hope for updates and mod support, but as of right now, I would recommend on holding off buying this game.",Negative

Game crash and have to reinstall,Negative
This game is absolutely horrible. At one point I had no boat and could not build anything. I had been playing for an hour so I am uninstalling and leaving this bad review. Never buy this game unless free but still it just takes up storage. The equivillant of this would be to store every single dump you took in your entire life and had it so that people could buy your dumps and place them around their house. You would most likely catch a felony for this just like how your gonna catch a felony if you try to have fun playing this game. Would not reccomend.,Negative

"My problem is not so much with the game as it is with steam support.  I purchased the bundle and immediately ran the tutorial.  As I could not save where I was in the tutorial I kept on going but had to stop without finishing so the next day I tried the tutorial again without finishing.  So the next day I tried playing a game with what I have learned and was able to save the game but after saving it and trying to get back to my desktop everything locked up and I had to shut down my computer. So the next day I tried loading the previous day's save and it worked so I then tried getting back to my desktop again and again everything locked up.  This is when I requested a refund as I could not play, save, completely shut down my computer and restart it again each time I played.  There must be a bug.  Anyway support refused the refund stating ""I played more than two hours therefore no refund was forthcoming"".  You can't even get through the tutorial in two hours so how can a newbie determine whether you want to keep the game.  Shame on them!  Last game I buy through steam!!",Negative

"Simply a Fallout 4 online in West Virginia mountains, fun game with amazingly friendly playerbase. Right outside vault 76, when you start the game, there were two high levels in power armor, they gave me any supplies I could use then, and they escorted me to the Wayward. There are frequent themed updates so the game stays pretty fresh. Highly recommend this game",Positive
I like that it has mods for some of my favorite things like fnaf and baldi's basics. I like the youtube content made from gmod. I don't like errors they can somtimes be hard to get rid of and can crash your game.,Positive

"I got this game plus Spider-Man remastered.  Loved the first game, but had a few crashes.  Nothing I can't get past.  So once I finished that one I booted up Miles Morales.  I loved most of the changes to the game and the story seems amazing...but I can't go any further.  I'm 5.5 hours into the game and when ever I try to load the game up it crashes.  I'm not about to replay those 5.5 hours.  It's very disappointing because it feels like it got just as much love, if not more than the remastered spider-man.  I was willing to excuse the random crash here and there but the fact that I can't load my game at all anymore is horrible, especially for a game that is 1 year old",Negative

From animals being on fire, to people following your character at crazy speeds, to people spamming chest, to your horse exploding, it makes it impossible to complete missions.",Negative

I don't recommend it because of the price. It's a very short game. I also don't recommend it because it's very repetitive to the point where the game itself is just about collecting items. It also has crashing issues that I didn't encounter until the very last mission which sucks.,Negative
Dont buy it! This game is too short,Negative
"They somehow took the souls formula and cooked up something that is basically a distilled version of all the things that make playing souls games fun. Instead of having a lot of obscure quests that you never know when and where to trigger, they tell you. Instead of needing to master every mechanic to barely survive, they allow you to complete the game much more attuned to your personal flow. And yes, the flow is definitely there, like being on an adventure cruise instead of being lost in an adventure jungle.I really liked it.",Positive

Like there is some collision point on the gun that catches the surface.  Sometimes I can't pick the gun up, sometimes it's weirdly wobbling longways upside upways.  The messed up thing is this wasn't an issue before for me so wtf happened?  So much progress since launch and yet I still find places in the desert I can see layers of mesh through an un-rendered hole in the ground.

"I love Dark Souls and many Soul-like games, but I never liked Sekiro. This game reminds me too much of that game. Many people recommended this game to me and told me about the versatility of combat the game had. After playing through the game, it was mostly a lie. Most builds are pretty much the same with one or two differences. I was never tempted to respect because I could play any weapon with any build without much notable change in damage. This is why it reminded me of Sekiro. To anyone who likes their stat choices to matter I don't recommend this game.P.S. There where many other thing that made me give this game a negative review, but all those things have been said in other reviews.",Negative
"Don't know what it was like at release, but with a good PC the graphics are pretty amazing and it runs well.

More DLC, more Panam!",Positive

"Honestly I want to love this game, after falling in love with CS1 a few years ago I jumped the gun and pre-bought this. I have played on and off for a few months now. Whilst the game has some major improvements over the first it is just unplayable in it's current state. Starting with the basics the tutorial  is bare bones and considering how much new content there is there should be a more in depth tutorial. For instance i had a city of around 30,000 with no high residential demand, after watching youtube I realised that I can tax each type of residential differently. Also the game really hates the player placing larger buildings, i have had my pc crash a few times placing the international airport and lag like hell when using other large buildings. The traffic system is messed up as hell. Economy is not fully balanced and can be difficult for new players to understand or even generate money, however this game is much more forgiving with the amount of cash you start with and get per milestone.Ps. for new players if you wanna unlock many development points to begin, place water pumps until lv4 then place the park that costs 5,000 which gives 100xp its tedious and long but you can get to grand metropolis without having a single citizen then plan out the perfect city.",Negative

"The game in the current state is too unfinished to be considered a full release. I've experienced problems with simulation, graphics and processing issues. Per now it also looks like content that should have been released with the game, are postponed to early next year. Since modding is missing, I also find that there is a severe lack in content. Most games released in this state use the label ""early acesss"".In the future this could become a good city builder. As of now I cannot recommend buying it.",Negative

Product received for freeMy boyfriend and I have been having a blast playing this game together and I thoroughly recommend it for any couples looking for an easygoing fun time. Definitely something you can sink several hours into without thinking about it.,Positive
nice game,Positive
Now it is a good game,Positive
"Much fun! Good for solo or with friends because you can make new friends with the friendly strangers! Game glitches just adds character to the game, as a 90's kid, glitches in games are normal. Makes it funny.I wish the stash inventory can carry more though, I'm just a loot goblin trying to survive post-apocalypse.This is my first fallout game on PC and can't wait to try other Fallout games!",Positive
I'm insane now,Negative
Fun game to run around and play,Positive
